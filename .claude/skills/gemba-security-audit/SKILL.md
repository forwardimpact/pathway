  Perform a holistic security review of the monorepo. Assess GitHub Actions
  supply chain, dependency hygiene, credential leak controls, CI audit gates,
  and application-level vulnerabilities. Use when reviewing PRs for security
  impact, auditing the repo security posture, investigating a reported
  vulnerability, or checking for credential leaks and supply chain risks.

# Security Audit

## 1. Supply Chain — GitHub Actions

- All third-party actions pinned to full SHA with version comment (`# v4`).
- Only first-party (`actions/*`) or official org actions permitted.
- All workflows must declare explicit `permissions` with least privilege.
- Dependabot configured to propose updates to action SHAs.

## 2. Supply Chain — npm Dependencies

Dependency policy in CONTRIBUTING.md § Dependency Policy. Additionally verify:

- Publish workflows gate on `npm audit` results
- No packages with known CVEs remain unpatched

## 3. Credential & Secret Leak Prevention

Rules in CONTRIBUTING.md § Security. Additionally verify:

- `.gitignore` covers sensitive patterns (`.env`, credentials, keys)
- `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist exists for known false positives
- Secrets in workflows use `secrets.*` — no hardcoded values

## 4. Static Analysis

Verify no security rules disabled in `eslint.config.js` without inline
justification.

## 5. Application Security (OWASP Top 10)

Check for: injection (shell, SQL, template), broken auth, sensitive data
exposure, security misconfiguration (CORS, headers), vulnerable components
(`npm audit`), insufficient logging, SSRF, insecure deserialization (untrusted
YAML/JSON without schema validation).

## 6. CI/CD Security

Verify publish workflows block on audit failures and CI/local workflows run the
same checks.

## 7. Focused Audit Strategy

Each run covers **one topic** in depth.

### Topic areas

| Topic                        | What to audit                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `actions-supply-chain`       | SHA pins, permissions, third-party action usage             |
| `npm-dependencies`           | `npm audit`, duplicates, outdated packages, CVE triage      |
| `credential-leak-prevention` | `.gitignore`, `.gitleaks.toml`, secrets in workflows, hooks |
| `static-analysis`            | ESLint security rules, disabled rules, config gaps          |
| `app-security-services`      | OWASP Top 10 in `services/` code                            |
| `app-security-libraries`     | OWASP Top 10 in `libraries/` code                           |
| `app-security-products`      | OWASP Top 10 in `products/` code                            |
| `cicd-pipeline`              | Workflow integrity, publish gates, audit gates              |

### Topic selection

1. Read memory per the agent profile (your summary, the current week's log, and
   teammates' summaries). Find last audit dates per topic in the coverage map.
2. Build coverage map — never-audited topics go first, then oldest.
3. Revisit threshold — if all topics covered within last 4 runs, revisit oldest.
4. Announce your pick and why before starting.
5. Go deep — read every relevant file, not just grep for patterns.

## 8. Audit Checklist

<do_confirm_checklist>

- [ ] Ran `just audit` locally and reported findings.
- [ ] Reviewed `.github/workflows/` for unpinned actions, missing permissions.
- [ ] Reviewed `package.json` files for unnecessary or duplicate dependencies.
- [ ] Reviewed `.gitignore` and `.gitleaks.toml` for coverage gaps.
- [ ] Reviewed `eslint.config.js` for disabled security rules.
- [ ] Grepped for vulnerability patterns: `eval(`, `child_process.exec(`,
      `innerHTML`, `new Function(`, unsanitized template literals in SQL/shell
      contexts.

## 9. Output

Every audit must produce both categories when applicable — incremental fixes on
a `fix/` branch and specs for structural findings on `spec/` branches. Branch
naming, commit conventions, and independence rules are defined in the agent
profile.

### Memory: what to record

Append to the current week's log (see agent profile for the file path):

- **Topic audited** — Which topic and why selected
- **Coverage map** — Updated table of all topics with last audit date
- **Findings summary** — What found, severity, disposition
  (fixed/spec'd/deferred)
- **Deferred work** — Issues needing follow-up with enough context to resume
- CVEs evaluated and their status
- Policy violations found and whether fixed or spec'd
