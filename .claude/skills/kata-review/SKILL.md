  Grade a single artifact (spec, design, plan, or implementation diff) against
  quality criteria and return findings by severity. Use when another skill
  spawns a fresh sub-agent for an independent review of its work. This skill
  never spawns sub-agents — it produces findings only — which structurally
  prevents the spec/design/plan/implement review loop from recursing.

# Review

Independent grading skill for artifacts produced by `kata-spec`, `kata-design`,
`kata-plan`, and `kata-implement`. Returns severity-graded findings; takes no
action. Never spawns sub-agents.

## When to Use

- A `kata-spec`, `kata-design`, `kata-plan`, or `kata-implement` workflow has
  reached its clean sub-agent review step and you have been spawned with no
  prior context to grade the artifact.
- Any time another agent needs an independent quality grade on a spec, design,
  plan, or diff without changing it.

## Invariant: never spawn

This skill's Process has **no step that launches a sub-agent**. That is the
property that prevents the spec / plan / implement review loop from recursing —
if you find yourself wanting to make an `Agent` tool call from inside this
skill, stop and return findings instead. See
[KATA.md § Recursion-safe self-review](../../../KATA.md#recursion-safe-self-review)
for the full design rationale.

## Severity Vocabulary

This is the canonical definition of review severity for the spec → plan →
implement arc. Grade every finding using exactly one level:

- **Blocker** — The work is broken, dangerous, or materially wrong. Must fix
  before advancing (approving the spec, advancing status, merging code).
- **High** — A correctness or clarity problem that will cause rework, confusion,
  or bugs downstream if shipped. Fix before advancing.
- **Medium** — A real quality or consistency issue worth fixing now while the
  context is fresh. Fix before advancing.
- **Low** — Nit or preference. Optional; document if dismissed.

The caller is required to **verify** every finding against the actual artifact
before acting on it — sub-agent reviewers operate without prior conversation
context and can misread intent, miss surrounding code, or flag false positives.
After verification, the caller must address every confirmed **blocker**,
**high**, and **medium** finding before advancing. **Low** findings are
optional.

## Process

1. **Identify the artifact type.** The caller tells you whether the input is a
   `spec.md`, a `design-a.md`, a `plan-a.md` (plus any decomposed parts), or a
   code diff (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`). You are spawned cold with no
   back-channel to the caller — if the artifact type or path is genuinely
   ambiguous, return a single **Blocker** finding asking for clarification and
   stop. Do not guess.

2. **Read the artifact and directly relevant context.** For a design, read the
   spec it targets. For a plan, read the spec and design it targets. For a diff,
   read the spec, the design, the plan, and CONTRIBUTING.md § Core Rules. Read
   once, fully, before grading.

3. **Grade against the artifact-specific criteria** in the section below. For
   each gap or risk, write one finding with:
   - File path and line number (or commit hash)
   - The criterion violated, in one short phrase
   - Severity per the vocabulary above
   - One-sentence explanation

4. **Return findings only.** Do not modify the artifact, do not open PRs, do not
   invoke other skills, do not spawn sub-agents. Group findings by severity and
   report.

## Artifact Criteria

Grade each artifact against its skill's DO-CONFIRM checklist. The deltas below
are review-specific additions on top of the checklist.

### spec.md

Skill: [`kata-spec`](../kata-spec/SKILL.md). No review-specific deltas.

### design-a.md

Skill: [`kata-design`](../kata-design/SKILL.md). Delta: **over 200 lines is a
Blocker.**

### plan-a.md (and parts)

Skill: [`kata-plan`](../kata-plan/SKILL.md). No review-specific deltas.

### Implementation diff

Match
[`kata-implement` § Final verification](../kata-implement/SKILL.md#7-final-verification)
and CONTRIBUTING.md § Core Rules. Look for:

- Diff implements every spec success criterion
- No scope creep (refactors, features, cleanup beyond the plan)
- Atomic, conventional-style commits on the branch
- Plan deviations noted in commit messages where present
- No security regressions (input validation at boundaries, secrets, dangerous
  shell)

You may run `bun run check` and `bun run test` yourself to verify the head
commit, or trust the caller's assertion that they pass — the caller's Step 7
already requires green checks before delegating to you. Treat any test or lint
failure you observe as at minimum a **High** finding.

## Output Format

Return findings grouped by severity exactly in this shape:

```text
### Blocker
- <file:line> — <criterion> — <one-sentence reason>
- ...
(or "none")

### High
- ...

### Medium
- ...

### Low
- ...
```

Each finding is one line: `file:line — criterion — one-sentence reason`. No
preamble, no summary, no conclusion. The severity headers are the only prose. Be
honest and specific. Do not invent findings to look thorough. Do not
rubber-stamp.

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not spawn sub-agents.** This skill must remain a leaf in the call graph;
  spawning would re-introduce the recursion this skill exists to prevent.
- **Do not modify the artifact.** Reviewers grade; they do not edit.
- **Do not open PRs, comments, or commits.** Findings are returned to the
  caller, who decides what to act on.
- **Do not invoke `kata-spec`, `kata-design`, `kata-plan`, or
  `kata-implement`.** Their Process steps would spawn another reviewer and loop.
