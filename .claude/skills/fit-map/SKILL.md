# Map Product

A public site describing the data model for consumption by AI agents and
engineers. Map is the fundamental underpinning of all Forward Impact products—it
defines how engineering competencies, career progression, and agent capabilities
are structured in a machine-readable format.

Making the data model well understood is a first-class goal. It is published in
structured formats (JSON Schema, RDF/SHACL) so that AI agents can reliably
interpret and work with career framework data.

## When to Use

- Adding or modifying skills in capability files
- Adding new behaviours, disciplines, tracks, or levels
- Working with JSON Schema or RDF/SHACL definitions
- Running data validation
- Adding interview questions
- Generating browser index files
- Improving schema documentation for public consumption

## Product Structure

```
products/map/
  src/
    loader.js            # Load and parse YAML data files
    validation.js        # Data validation logic
    schema-validation.js # JSON Schema validation
    index-generator.js   # Generate _index.yaml for browser
    levels.js            # Skill proficiencies, behaviour maturities
    modifiers.js         # Modifier utilities
  schema/
    json/                # JSON Schema definitions (public)
    rdf/                 # RDF/SHACL ontology (public)
  examples/              # Canonical example data
```

## CLI

```sh
npx fit-map validate          # Validate all data
npx fit-map generate-index    # Generate browser indexes
npx fit-map validate --shacl  # Validate RDF/SHACL
```

## Key Modules

### loader.js

Loads and parses YAML data files into JavaScript objects.

```javascript
import { loadAllData, loadCapabilities } from "@forwardimpact/map/loader";
const data = await loadAllData("./data");
```

### validation.js

Validates data against business rules (referential integrity, required fields).

```javascript
import { validateAll } from "@forwardimpact/map/validation";
const errors = validateAll(data);
```

### schema-validation.js

Validates data against JSON Schema definitions.

### levels.js

Exports skill proficiency and behaviour maturity constants.

```javascript
import {
  SKILL_PROFICIENCIES,
  BEHAVIOUR_MATURITIES,
} from "@forwardimpact/map/levels";
```

### index-generator.js

Generates `_index.yaml` files for browser-based data loading.

## Schema Definitions

### JSON Schema (`schema/json/`)

Validates YAML structure. One schema per entity type.

### RDF/SHACL (`schema/rdf/`)

Semantic representation for linked data interoperability.

**Schema Synchronization:** When adding or modifying properties, update both
`schema/json/` and `schema/rdf/` in the same commit. The two formats must stay
in sync.

## Example Data (`examples/`)

Canonical reference data for testing and documentation:

```
examples/
├── levels.yaml           # Career levels
├── stages.yaml           # Lifecycle stages
├── drivers.yaml          # Organizational outcomes
├── disciplines/          # Engineering specialties
├── tracks/               # Work contexts
├── behaviours/           # Approach to work
├── capabilities/         # Skills grouped by area
└── questions/            # Interview questions
```

## Common Tasks

### Add a Skill

1. Add skill to capability file
   `products/map/examples/capabilities/{capability_id}.yaml`
2. Add skill object with `id`, `name`, and `human:` section
3. Include level descriptions for all five levels
4. Reference skill in disciplines (coreSkills/supportingSkills/broadSkills)
5. Add questions to `products/map/examples/questions/skills/{skill_id}.yaml`
6. Optionally add `agent:` section for AI coding agent support
7. Run `npx fit-map validate`

### Add Interview Questions

Location:

- Skills: `products/map/examples/questions/skills/{skill_id}.yaml`
- Behaviours: `products/map/examples/questions/behaviours/{behaviour_id}.yaml`

Required properties:

| Property     | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | Format: `{abbrev}_{level_abbrev}_{number}`     |
| `text`       | Question text (second person, under 150 chars) |
| `lookingFor` | 2-4 bullet points of good answer indicators    |

### Add Agent Skill Section

1. Add `agent:` section to skill in capability file
2. Include: `name`, `description`, `useWhen`, `stages`
3. Define stage guidance: `focus`, `activities[]`, `ready[]`
4. Run `npx fit-map validate`

```yaml
agent:
  name: skill-name-kebab-case
  description: Brief description
  useWhen: When agents should apply this skill
  stages:
    plan:
      focus: Planning objectives
      activities: [...]
      ready: [...]
    code:
      focus: Implementation objectives
      activities: [...]
      ready: [...]
```

### Add Tool Reference

Add `toolReferences:` to skill in capability file:

```yaml
toolReferences:
  - name: Langfuse
    url: https://langfuse.com/docs
    description: LLM observability platform
    useWhen: Instrumenting AI applications
```

## Verification

Always run validation after changes:

```sh
npx fit-map validate
```
