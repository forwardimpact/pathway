# Product PR Classification

Triage all open pull requests, verify contributor trust, run the gate
checks, and produce a report stating which PRs are ready to merge and
which are blocked. The merge action itself belongs to the
[`gemba-product-merge`](../gemba-product-merge/SKILL.md) skill (Do phase).

This skill handles **all non-Dependabot PRs** — both external contributions
and PRs created by our own CI app (`forward-impact-ci`). Because external
contributions merge here, contributor trust verification is the most
critical gate. The improvement coach audits classification traces via the
[`gemba-trace-audit`](../gemba-trace-audit/SKILL.md) skill to confirm trust checks
happened on every PR that advanced to merge.

## When to Use

- Reviewing open PRs for product alignment on a schedule
- On-demand when specific PRs need a mergeability decision
- Before any merge is performed

## Prerequisites

See [`gemba-gh-cli`](../gemba-gh-cli/SKILL.md) for `gh` installation and the
canonical query shapes used in the steps below — in particular the
contributor trust lookup, which `gemba-trace-audit` verifies against.

All comment templates and the report format are in `references/templates.md`.

## Gate Checklist

| #   | Gate                                  | Verification                     | On failure                                                            |
| --- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Author is trusted                     | CI app or top-20 lookup (Step 2) | Mark **blocked** — comment that only trusted authors merge            |
| 2   | PR type is `fix`, `bug`, or `spec`    | Parse title prefix (Step 3)      | Mark **blocked** — comment that the PR type is outside scope          |
| 3   | All CI checks pass                    | `gh pr checks` (Step 4)          | Mark **blocked** — comment with the failing checks                    |
| 4   | Spec quality approved (spec PRs only) | Apply `gemba-spec` review (Step 5) | Mark **blocked** — comment with review findings                     |

A PR that passes all four gates is marked **mergeable** in the report;
`gemba-product-merge` then performs the merge in the Do phase.

## Process

### Step 0: Read Memory

Read memory per the agent profile (your summary, the current week's log,
and teammates' summaries). From prior `product-manager` entries, extract
PRs blocked in previous runs with consecutive-block counts and contributor
trust decisions carried forward.

### Step 1: List Open PRs

```sh
gh pr list --state open --base main \
  --json number,title,headRefName,author,updatedAt,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,labels
```

Skip PRs authored by `app/dependabot` — handled by `gemba-security-update`.

### Step 2: Verify Contributor Trust

Check whether the author is the CI app:

```sh
gh pr view <number> --json author --jq '.author.login'
```

If `app/forward-impact-ci`, the PR is **trusted by definition** — skip the
contributor lookup and proceed to Step 3.

For all other authors, look up the top 20 human contributors (canonical
shape: [`gemba-gh-cli` § Contributor trust lookup](../gemba-gh-cli/SKILL.md#contributor-trust-lookup-top-20-gate)):

```sh
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.type == "User")] | .[0:20] | .[].login'
```

The PR author must appear in this list. If not, mark **blocked** and
record the decision (the gemba-trace-audit skill checks that this lookup
happened on every classified PR).

### Step 3: Classify PR Type

Parse the title using `type(scope): subject` convention:

- `fix` or `bug` → eligible (bug treated as equivalent to fix)
- `spec` → eligible (after spec review in Step 5)
- Breaking variants with `!` retain the base type
- Any other type (`feat`, `refactor`, `chore`, etc.) → mark **blocked**

### Step 4: Check CI Status

```sh
gh pr checks <number>
```

All checks must pass. If failing, identify specific failures:

```sh
gh pr checks <number> --json name,state,conclusion \
  --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion != "SUCCESS" and .conclusion != "") | {name, conclusion}'
```

Mark **blocked** with the specific failing checks.

### Step 5: Review Spec PRs

For `spec` PRs, apply the `gemba-spec` skill's review process:

1. Identify the spec directory from changed files:
   ```sh
   gh pr view <number> --json files --jq '.files[].path' | grep '^specs/'
   ```
2. Check out the spec files:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin <headRefName>
   git checkout origin/<headRefName> -- specs/<matched-directory>/
   ```
3. Evaluate against spec review criteria. Report decision and target
   status — do not update `specs/STATUS` directly.
4. If spec fails review, mark **blocked** with findings.
5. If spec passes, mark **mergeable**.

### Step 6: Produce the Classification Report

For each PR, record: number, title, type, author, trust check result, CI
status, spec review (if applicable), and final verdict — **mergeable** or
**blocked** with reason. The report is the deliverable of this skill.

The report is consumed by the `gemba-product-merge` skill, which performs the
actual merge for each mergeable PR.

## Memory: What to Record

Append to the current week's log (see agent profile for the file path):

- **PR classification table** — Each PR with type, author, trust check,
  CI, verdict, and consecutive-block count
- **Contributor trust decisions** — Who was verified and the result (this
  is the data the gemba-trace-audit skill checks)
- **Spec review results** — Spec PRs and their assessment
