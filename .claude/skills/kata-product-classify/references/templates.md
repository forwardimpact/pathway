# Product Backlog Templates

Comment templates and report formats for PR triage.

## Skip Comments

### Untrusted Author

```sh
gh pr comment <number> --body "Product backlog triage: skipping — author \`<login>\` is not in the top 7 contributors. Requires human review."
```

### Unsupported PR Type

```sh
gh pr comment <number> --body "Product backlog triage: skipping — PR type \`<type>\` requires human review."
```

### CI Failing

Comment with the specific failing checks from `gh pr checks`.

## Merge Comment

```sh
gh pr comment <number> --body "Product backlog triage: all gates pass — type is \`<type>\`, CI green, author is trusted contributor. Merging."
gh pr merge <number> --squash --auto
```

After merging, verify state:

```sh
gh pr view <number> --json state --jq '.state'
```

If still `OPEN` (auto-merge pending), note this in the summary rather than
reporting as merged.

**Flag PRs skipped across 3+ consecutive runs** — these may need escalation.
Call them out prominently above the table.
