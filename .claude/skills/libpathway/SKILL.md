# Libpathway Package

Pure business logic for deriving jobs, agent profiles, skill matrices, and
career progression from schema data.

## When to Use

- Modifying job derivation logic (skill proficiencies, behaviour maturities)
- Changing agent profile generation
- Working with skill modifier resolution
- Updating checklist derivation for stage transitions
- Modifying interview question selection
- Changing career progression analysis

## Package Structure

```
libs/libpathway/src/
  derivation.js   # Core: deriveSkillMatrix, deriveBehaviourProfile, deriveJob
  modifiers.js    # Skill modifier resolution
  profile.js      # Post-processing: filtering, sorting for agents
  job.js          # Job preparation for display
  job-cache.js    # Job caching for pages
  agent.js        # Agent profile/skill generation
  checklist.js    # Stage transition checklists
  interview.js    # Interview question selection
  matching.js     # Job matching logic
  progression.js  # Career progression analysis
```

## Key Modules

### derivation.js

Core derivation functions used by all consumers.

```javascript
import {
  deriveSkillMatrix,
  deriveBehaviourProfile,
  deriveJob,
} from "@forwardimpact/libpathway/derivation";
```

### profile.js

Agent-specific filtering and sorting:

- Excludes `isHumanOnly` skills
- Keeps only highest proficiency per skill
- Sorts by proficiency (highest first)

```javascript
import { prepareAgentProfile } from "@forwardimpact/libpathway/profile";
```

### job.js / job-cache.js

Job preparation and caching for web pages.

```javascript
import { getOrCreateJob } from "@forwardimpact/libpathway/job-cache";
```

### agent.js

Agent profile and skill file generation.

```javascript
import {
  deriveAgentSkills,
  generateStageAgentProfile,
} from "@forwardimpact/libpathway/agent";
```

### interview.js

Question selection based on role requirements.

### progression.js

Career progression analysis between levels.

## Job Derivation

Jobs are derived from `Discipline × Level × Track?`:

1. Base skill proficiencies from level (by skill type: primary/secondary/broad)
2. Track modifiers applied to capabilities (+1, 0, -1)
3. Behaviour modifiers combined from discipline and track
4. Responsibilities by discipline type (professional/management)

```
Final Proficiency = clamp(Base Proficiency + Track Modifier, awareness, level ceiling)
```

## Agent Profiles

Agent profiles use the same derivation as jobs, filtered for AI-applicable
capabilities:

```
Agent Profile = Discipline × Track × Stage
```

- Uses practitioner-level reference level
- Excludes `isHumanOnly` skills
- Constrained by stage tools and permissions

## Pure Functions

All derivation functions are pure:

- No side effects
- Same inputs → same outputs
- No external state access

This makes them easy to test and reason about.

## Verification

Run tests after changes:

```sh
npm run test
```
