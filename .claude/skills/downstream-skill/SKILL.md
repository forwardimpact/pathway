# Downstream

Study downstream Basecamp installations, read their skill changelogs, and bring
improvements upstream into the monorepo template and canonical skill data.

## Trigger

Run this skill when:

- The user asks to check downstream installations for skill changes
- The user wants to incorporate field-tested improvements from installations
- Periodically reviewing what downstream users have changed in their skills

## Prerequisites

- Access to downstream installation directories
- The downstream installation has run the **upstream** skill to produce a
  changelog

## Downstream Installations

| Installation | Path                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Personal     | `~/Documents/Personal/` |

## Inputs

- `<installation>/.claude/skills/*/CHANGELOG.md` — per-skill changelogs produced
  by the upstream skill in each installation
- `<installation>/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — current skill files in the
  installation
- `products/basecamp/template/.claude/skills/` — canonical template skills in
  this monorepo

## Outputs

- Updated skills in `products/basecamp/template/.claude/skills/`
- Updated capability data in `data/pathway/capabilities/` (when changes affect
  agent skill definitions)
- Summary of what was incorporated and what was deferred

---

## Process

### Step 1: Read Downstream Changelogs

For each downstream installation, check for per-skill changelogs:

```bash
# List all skill changelogs in the installation
for f in ~/Documents/Personal/.claude/skills/*/CHANGELOG.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && echo "--- $f ---" && cat "$f"
done
```

If no changelogs exist, the installation hasn't run the **upstream** skill yet.
Report this and stop — do not try to infer changes without structured
changelogs.

### Step 2: Identify Unprocessed Entries

Read each skill's changelog and identify entries that haven't been processed
yet. Track processing state in `.claude/memory/downstream-skill.md`
(gitignored). Record what was reviewed, what was incorporated, and what was
deferred.

For each unprocessed entry, record:

- Skill name (from the directory containing the changelog)
- Change type (added / modified / removed)
- What changed and why
- The date of the change

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Change

For each unprocessed changelog entry, evaluate whether it should be brought
upstream. Read both the changelog description and the actual skill file in the
installation:

```bash
# Read the modified skill in the installation
cat ~/Documents/Personal/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Then compare with the canonical template:

```bash
# Read the canonical template skill
cat products/basecamp/template/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

#### Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion             | Include upstream?                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fixes a real bug      | Yes — apply the fix                                    |
| Improves workflow     | Yes — if the improvement is general, not personal      |
| Adds safety checks    | Yes — defensive improvements benefit all users         |
| New skill (general)   | Yes — add to template if useful for most installations |
| New skill (personal)  | No — too specific to one user's workflow               |
| Removes a step        | Maybe — understand why, it may indicate a design issue |
| Changes paths/configs | No — likely installation-specific                      |
| Style-only changes    | No — not worth the churn                               |

Ask: _"Would this change benefit a new Basecamp installation, or is it specific
to this user's setup?"_

### Step 4: Apply Upstream Changes

For changes that should be brought upstream, apply them to the canonical
template skills:

**For modified skills:**

Read the downstream version and the upstream version. Apply the specific
improvement described in the changelog — do not blindly overwrite the upstream
file with the downstream version, as the downstream file may contain
installation-specific customizations mixed with general improvements.

```bash
# Edit the template skill
# products/basecamp/template/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

**For new skills:**

Copy the skill directory into the template:

```bash
ls ~/Documents/Personal/.claude/skills/<new-skill>/
cat ~/Documents/Personal/.claude/skills/<new-skill>/SKILL.md
```

Review the skill for installation-specific content (hardcoded paths, user names,
personal preferences) and generalize before adding to the template.

**For capability data changes:**

If the changelog describes changes to agent skill definitions (stages,
checklists, tool references, instructions), also update the capability YAML
files:

- `data/pathway/capabilities/{id}.yaml`

After updating capability data, validate:

```bash
bunx fit-map validate
```

### Step 5: Verify Changes

After applying upstream changes:

1. **Diff the template** to confirm only intended changes were made:

```bash
git diff products/basecamp/template/.claude/skills/
```

2. **Run validation** if capability data was changed:

```bash
bunx fit-map validate
```

3. **Check for consistency** — if a skill was updated in the template, ensure
   related skills weren't left inconsistent (e.g., if `extract-entities` changed
   its output format, do skills that consume its output still work?).

### Step 6: Report

Summarize what was done:

```markdown
## Downstream Sync

### Incorporated
- **<skill>**: <one-line summary of what was brought upstream>

### Deferred
- **<skill>**: <one-line summary> — Reason: <why it was not included>

### No Changelog
- **<installation>**: No changelog found — upstream skill not yet run
```

### Step 7: Update Memory

After processing, update `.claude/memory/downstream-skill.md` with:

- What was processed (skill names and change summaries)
- What was incorporated upstream
- What was deferred and why

Keep the note concise — just enough state to avoid re-processing the same
changes. Do not maintain a detailed audit trail of every change.
