# Product Feedback Triage

Triage all open GitHub issues for product alignment, classify them by type and
scope, and take action: implement trivial fixes directly or write specs for
product-aligned improvements. Issues that fall outside the product vision are
labelled and skipped.

## When to Use

- Reviewing and actioning open issues for product alignment
- Scheduled to process community feedback regularly
- On-demand when the issue backlog needs attention

## Prerequisites

The `gh` CLI must be installed and authenticated. See the `gh-cli` skill for
installation instructions. Verify with:

```sh
gh auth status
```

## Classification

Each issue is classified into one of three categories based on its content:

| Category            | Criteria                                                       | Action          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Trivial fix/bug** | Clear bug report or small fix with obvious resolution          | Implement + PR  |
| **Product-aligned** | Feature request or improvement aligned with the product vision | Write spec + PR |
| **Out of scope**    | Not aligned with products, unclear, or already addressed       | Label + comment |

### Product vision alignment

Use CLAUDE.md and JTBD.md to determine whether an issue aligns with the product
vision. The six products and their questions:

| Product      | Question it answers                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Map**      | What does good engineering look like here?        |
| **Pathway**  | Where does my career path go from here?           |
| **Basecamp** | Am I prepared for what's ahead today?             |
| **Guide**    | How do I find my bearing?                         |
| **Landmark** | What milestones has my engineering reached?       |
| **Summit**   | Is this team supported to reach peak performance? |

An issue is product-aligned if it describes a need that one of these products
should address for its users (Leadership, Developers, or Agents).

## Process

### Step 0: Read Memory for Issue History

Before listing issues, read all files in the memory directory. From previous
`product-manager-*.md` entries (this skill runs under the product-manager
agent), extract:

- Issues that were previously processed and their outcomes
- Recurring themes or requests that inform prioritization

Also check entries from other agents — the improvement coach may have noted
user-facing issues in traces, or the security engineer may have flagged
vulnerabilities reported as issues.

### Step 1: List Open Issues

```sh
gh issue list --state open --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,body,author,labels,createdAt,updatedAt \
  --jq '.[] | {number, title, author: .author.login, labels: [.labels[].name], created: .createdAt}'
```

Skip issues that already have a `triaged` or `wontfix` label — those have been
processed.

### Step 2: Read and Classify Each Issue

For each open issue, read the full details:

```sh
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,comments,labels,author
```

Classify the issue:

1. **Trivial fix/bug** — The issue describes a clear, reproducible bug or a
   small fix. The root cause is identifiable from the description, and the fix
   is mechanical (e.g., typo, broken link, incorrect validation, missing edge
   case). The change would touch a small number of files with an obvious
   resolution.

2. **Product-aligned** — The issue describes a feature request, enhancement, or
   improvement that serves one of the six products and its users. The issue has
   enough detail to understand the need, even if the solution requires design
   work.

3. **Out of scope** — The issue does not align with any product, is a duplicate,
   is unclear and lacks enough context to act on, or has already been addressed.

### Step 3: Handle Trivial Fixes/Bugs

For issues classified as trivial fixes or bugs:

1. Comment on the issue to acknowledge it and explain next steps:

```sh
gh issue comment <number> --body "Thanks for reporting this! I can see the problem — I'll put together a fix now.

— Product Manager 🌱"
```

2. Create a fix branch:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/issue-<number>-<short-description>
```

3. Investigate and implement the fix. Read relevant code, make the change, and
   verify it works.

4. Run quality checks:

```sh
bun run check
```

5. Commit and push:

```sh
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "fix(<scope>): <description>

Closes #<number>"
git push -u origin fix/issue-<number>-<short-description>
```

6. Create a PR:

```sh
gh pr create \
  --title "fix(<scope>): <description>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

<description of the fix>

Closes #<number>

## Test plan

- [ ] `bun run check` passes
- [ ] <specific verification>
EOF
)"
```

7. Label the issue as triaged:

```sh
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "triaged"
```

### Step 4: Handle Product-Aligned Issues

For issues classified as product-aligned, write a spec using the `write-spec`
skill:

1. Comment on the issue to acknowledge it and explain next steps:

```sh
gh issue comment <number> --body "Thanks for this suggestion! This aligns with our product direction. I'm going to write up a spec so we can plan the implementation properly.

— Product Manager 🌱"
```

2. Determine the next available spec number:

```sh
ls specs/ | sort -n | tail -1
```

3. Create a spec branch:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b spec/issue-<number>-<short-description>
```

4. Write the spec following the `write-spec` skill process. The spec should:
   - Reference the original issue (`#<number>`)
   - Define the problem from the issue reporter's perspective
   - Scope the change to what the issue describes
   - Define verifiable success criteria

5. Update `specs/STATUS` with the new spec in `draft` status.

6. Run quality checks:

```sh
bun run check
```

7. Commit and push:

```sh
git add specs/<NNN>-<name>/spec.md specs/STATUS
git commit -m "spec(<scope>): <description>

Addresses #<number>"
git push -u origin spec/issue-<number>-<short-description>
```

8. Create a PR:

```sh
gh pr create \
  --title "spec(<scope>): <description>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

Spec for issue #<number>: <issue title>

<brief description of what the spec proposes>

Addresses #<number>

## Review

This spec needs review before implementation can begin. See the `write-spec`
skill for the review process.
EOF
)"
```

9. Label the issue as triaged:

```sh
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "triaged"
```

### Step 5: Handle Out-of-Scope Issues

For issues classified as out of scope:

```sh
gh issue comment <number> --body "Thanks for taking the time to open this! After reviewing it against our product direction, this falls outside our current scope. <brief explanation of why>.

Closing for now — feel free to reopen with additional context if you think this assessment is off.

— Product Manager 🌱"
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "wontfix"
gh issue close <number>
```

For duplicate issues, reference the original:

```sh
gh issue comment <number> --body "Thanks for reporting this! This is already tracked in #<original>, so I'll close this one as a duplicate.

— Product Manager 🌱"
gh issue close <number> --reason "not planned"
```

For unclear issues that need more information:

```sh
gh issue comment <number> --body "Thanks for opening this! I'd like to help, but I need a bit more context to act on it. Could you provide <specific questions>?

— Product Manager 🌱"
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "needs-info"
```

Do **not** close unclear issues — leave them open for the reporter to respond.

### Step 6: Report Summary

After processing all issues, produce a summary table:

```
| Issue | Title                           | Category       | Action         | Detail                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| #12   | Schema validation crash on null | trivial fix    | PR #45         | Fix null check in validate |
| #8    | Support custom skill levels     | product-aligned| spec PR #46    | specs/220-custom-levels/   |
| #5    | Add dark mode                   | out of scope   | closed         | Not in product scope       |
| #3    | Unclear error message           | trivial fix    | PR #47         | Improve error text         |
| #1    | Integration with Jira           | out of scope   | needs-info     | Asked for use case detail  |
```

### Memory: what to record for product feedback triage

When writing your memory entry at the end of the run, include these
triage-specific fields in addition to the standard agent memory fields:

- **Issue triage table** — Each issue processed with category, action taken, and
  outcome (PR number, spec number, or close reason)
- **Recurring themes** — Feature requests or bug patterns that appear across
  multiple issues, noting frequency and product alignment
- **Specs created** — Spec numbers and their associated issues, for tracking
  through the spec lifecycle

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not implement features directly** — features require a spec, even if the
  fix seems straightforward. Only trivial bugs and small fixes get direct PRs.
- **Do not close unclear issues** — ask for more information and label with
  `needs-info` instead.
- **Do not skip the spec process** — product-aligned issues must go through the
  `write-spec` skill, not be implemented ad-hoc.
- **Do not make architectural decisions** — if a bug fix requires design work,
  classify it as product-aligned and write a spec.
- **Do not bypass quality checks** — run `bun run check` before every commit.
- **Do not process issues already labelled `triaged` or `wontfix`** — those have
  been handled.
