# GitHub CLI for Gemba workflows

Canonical `gh` usage for Gemba agents. By the time a skill invokes `gh`, the
workflow has already provisioned `GH_TOKEN` — the agent's concern is using `gh`
consistently, not authenticating it.

## When to Use

- You are a Gemba skill running inside a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow and
  need to read from or write to GitHub.
- You need the canonical shape for a cross-skill operation (e.g. contributor
  lookup) so your call matches what the `gemba-walk` invariant audit verifies.

For one-off interactive use outside CI, read `gh help` instead.

## Installation

Gemba runners do not ship `gh`. Install from the pinned tarball:

```sh
bash .claude/skills/gemba-gh-cli/scripts/install.sh [version]
```

Default version is `2.63.2`. Pass a version argument to override.

`apt-get install gh` often fails in sandboxed CI environments due to GPG key
issues. Always use the script above.

## CI runner quirks

**Proxied git remotes.** When the git remote uses a local proxy (e.g.
`http://local_proxy@127.0.0.1`), `gh` commands that infer the repo from the
remote may fail. Use `gh api` directly with explicit `{owner}/{repo}` paths
instead of the convenience commands.

**Check the active identity if something looks wrong.** `gh auth status` reports
who `gh` is acting as. If write operations are not landing under the expected
bot identity, stop and report — do not try to re-authenticate from inside the
skill.

## Gemba query patterns

These are the canonical shapes Gemba skills reuse. Match them exactly so the
`gemba-walk` invariant audit can verify the calls happened.

### List open PRs for triage

Used by `gemba-product-classify` and `gemba-release-readiness`.

```sh
gh pr list --state open --base main \
  --json number,title,author,headRefName,mergeable,mergeStateStatus
```

Narrow by author for Dependabot triage (used by `gemba-security-update`):

```sh
gh pr list --author 'app/dependabot' --state open \
  --json number,title,headRefName
```

### Contributor trust lookup (top-7 gate)

Used by `gemba-product-classify` before any external PR is marked mergeable. The
`gemba-walk` invariant audit verifies this call ran for every non-CI-app PR.

```sh
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.type == "User")] | .[0:7] | .[].login'
```

The `select(.type == "User")` filter excludes bot accounts from the top-7
ranking — a bot with high contribution volume must not gate human authors.

`app/forward-impact-ci` short-circuits the gate — skip the lookup for CI app PRs
and proceed directly to type classification.

### PR inspection

```sh
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,headRefName,files,commits,statusCheckRollup,mergeable,mergeStateStatus
gh pr checks <number>
gh pr diff <number>
```

### PR actions

```sh
# Comment (product-classify, security-update, release-readiness)
gh pr comment <number> --body "..."

# Merge
gh pr merge <number> --squash --auto           # external fix/bug PRs
gh pr merge <number> --merge --delete-branch   # agent-authored PRs

# Close with reason (security-update rejects policy violations)
gh pr close <number> --comment "..."
```

### List and view issues

Used by `gemba-product-triage`.

```sh
gh issue list --state open --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,author,labels,createdAt
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,comments,labels,author
```

### Workflow run artifacts

Used by `gemba-walk` to download traces and `gemba-release-review` to verify
publish runs.

```sh
# Find recent runs for a workflow on a branch
gh run list --branch main --limit 10 \
  --json name,conclusion,headBranch,event,databaseId

# Download a trace artifact
gh run download <run-id> --name combined-trace --dir /tmp/trace-<run-id>
gh run download <run-id> --name agent-trace --dir /tmp/trace-<run-id>

# Investigate a failed run
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

### Release creation

Used by `gemba-release-review`.

```sh
gh release create <tag> --title "<title>" --notes "<notes>"
```
