# Storyboard — YYYY Month

## Challenge

_The long-term direction that gives meaning to target conditions and
experiments. Changes rarely — only when strategic direction shifts._

> [Write the challenge here.]

## Target Condition

_The measurable state the team aims to reach by the end of this month. Not a
task list — a description of how the system will behave differently, expressed
in terms verifiable with data from metrics CSVs._

> [Write the target condition here. Include specific metrics and thresholds.]

**Due:** YYYY-MM-DD (end of month)

## Current Condition

_The measured state as of the last storyboard review. Updated daily using data
from wiki/metrics/. Always numbers, not narratives._

**Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

### Headlines

_Tight list of metrics whose status changed since the last meeting (new signal,
threshold crossed, classification flip). Empty if nothing changed — write
"None." on a single line._

- `{agent}` / `{metric}` — {value} {trend/badge} — {one-line reason}

### {agent}

#### {metric_name}

<!-- xmr:{metric_name}:wiki/metrics/{skill}/{YYYY}.csv -->
**Latest:** {value} · **Status:** {status from `bunx fit-xmr analyze`}

```
{14-line Wheeler/Vacanti X+mR chart. The chart labels μ, UPL, LPL, ±1.5σ
zones, URL, R, and the run index — do not restate any of those numbers outside
the chart.}
```

**Signals:** {fired-rule list (`xRule1`, `xRule2`, `xRule3`, `mrRule1`), or `—`
if none}
<!-- /xmr -->

_Note:_ {one line, only when `status` is `signals_present` or a fired rule needs
cross-referencing to a specific event; stable metrics get no prose}.

(Repeat one `#### metric_name` block per metric, grouped under `### {agent}`.
Run `bunx fit-wiki refresh <storyboard.md>` to regenerate all marker blocks
from CSV data. The chart is the visualization — do not duplicate its values in
surrounding prose. Agents add the cross-reference layer only where there is
something to say.)

## Obstacles

_What stands between the current condition and the target condition. Discovered
through experiments, not predicted upfront. Each obstacle is a labeled GitHub
issue; the storyboard carries one-line references. Full state lives in the
issue._

### Active

- **Current obstacle -->** Obstacle name (#NNN)
- Other obstacle (#NNN)

### Concluded (last 7 days)

_One line per item: status (RESOLVED/ABANDONED), date closed, one-sentence
verdict. Items older than 7 days are deleted; the closed issue is the permanent
record._

- ~~Obstacle name~~ (#NNN) — RESOLVED YYYY-MM-DD. [one-sentence verdict].

## Experiments

_PDSA cycles run against the current obstacle. Each experiment is a labeled
GitHub issue carrying the full PDSA content; the storyboard carries one-line
references._

### Active

- Exp N (#NNN) — [short name]

### Concluded (last 7 days)

_One line per item: verdict (DELIVERED/PASS/FAIL/ABANDONED), date closed,
one-sentence learning. Items older than 7 days are deleted; the closed issue is
the permanent record._

- **Exp N — [short name]** (#NNN) — DELIVERED YYYY-MM-DD. [one-sentence
  learning].

## Retention rule

When concluding an obstacle or experiment, post the verdict as a closing comment
on the issue, close the issue, and move the storyboard entry from `Active` to
`Concluded (last 7 days)`. At the start of every storyboard session, scan
`Concluded (last 7 days)` and delete any line whose closed-date is more than 7
days before today. The decision is mechanical — date math, not judgment. The
closed issue is the permanent record.
