  Triage open Dependabot PRs by applying repository policies from
  CONTRIBUTING.md. Merge PRs that pass all checks and policies, fix minor
  issues on a new branch, or close PRs that violate policy.

# Dependabot Triage

Triage all open Dependabot pull requests against the repository's dependency and
security policies, then take action: merge, fix, or close each PR.

## When to Use

- Reviewing and actioning open Dependabot PRs
- Batch-processing accumulated Dependabot PRs

## Prerequisites

The `gh` CLI must be installed and authenticated. Verify with `gh auth status`.

### GitHub Actions SHA Inventory

When evaluating check 2, verify the PR updates **all** workflow files that
reference the action:

| Action                          | Workflow files                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `actions/checkout`              | check-quality.yml, check-test.yml, check-security.yml, publish-npm.yml, publish-macos.yml, publish-skills.yml, website.yaml |

## Process

### Step 0: Read Memory

Read all memory files. Extract previous triage outcomes and packages that
repeatedly fail Check 8.

### Step 1: List Open Dependabot PRs

```sh
gh pr list --author 'app/dependabot' --state open \
  --json number,title,headRefName,labels,createdAt
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Each PR

```sh
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,headRefName,files,commits,statusCheckRollup,mergeable,mergeStateStatus
gh pr diff <number>
```

Determine update type from title: **patch** (low risk), **minor** (low risk),
**major** (check changelogs for breaking changes and transitive deps).

#### Check 8: Peer/Transitive Compatibility (npm major updates)

Run `bun pm ls` on the PR branch. Look for:

- **`invalid`** — resolved version violates another package's range. Close.
- **Nested duplicates in `bun.lock`** — lockfile creates nested entry for old
  major. Close until co-dependents release compatible ranges.
- **`deduped` across mismatched majors** — investigate before merging.

### Step 3: Take Action

#### Merge — all policies pass, CI green:

```sh
gh pr comment <number> --body "Dependabot triage: all policies pass, CI green. Merging."
gh pr merge <number> --squash --auto
```

#### Fix on new branch — minor policy violations fixable:

Claude Code cannot push to Dependabot branches. Create a new branch:

```sh
git fetch origin <dependabot-branch>
git checkout -b fix/dependabot-<number> origin/<dependabot-branch>
# Make fixes, run bun run check && just audit
git commit -m "fix(deps): <description for PR #number>"
git push -u origin fix/dependabot-<number>
gh pr create --title "chore(deps): <description> (fixed)" \
  --body "Fixes policy violations in Dependabot PR #<number>."
gh pr close <number> --comment "Superseded by #<new-pr> with policy fixes."
```

#### Close — policy violation cannot be fixed:

```sh
gh pr close <number> --comment "Dependabot triage: closing because <reason>. Policy: <which>."
```

### Step 4: Summary

```
| PR  | Title                          | Action | Reason                     |
| --- | ------------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------- |
| #67 | bump protobufjs 7.5.4 to 8.0.0 | close  | Check 8: peer incompatible |
| #61 | bump upload-pages-artifact ...  | fix    | Missing SHA pins           |
```

### Memory: what to record

Include these fields in addition to standard agent memory fields:

- **PR triage table** — Each PR with action, failed checks, and reason
- **Compatibility blockers** — Packages closed due to Check 8
- **Reverted merges** — PRs merged then reverted, with root cause
