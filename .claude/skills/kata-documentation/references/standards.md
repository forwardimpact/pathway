# Documentation Standards

## Information Architecture

Six-tier hierarchy under `websites/fit/docs/` serving four user groups
(Leadership, Engineers, Builders and Agents, Contributors):

| Tier              | Intent                              | Subsections                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getting-started` | "Get me going fast"                 | `leadership/`, `engineers/`, `contributors/`                                                                                                                                              |
| `products`        | "Help me accomplish a product task" | `authoring-standards/`, `agent-teams/`, `career-paths/`, `knowledge-systems/`, `landmark-quickstart/`, `team-capability/`, `finding-your-bearing/`                                        |
| `libraries`       | "Help me accomplish a library task" | `agent-evaluations/`, `agent-collaboration/`, `trace-analysis/`                                                                                                                           |
| `services`        | "Help me integrate with a service"  | One per service (`graph/`, `vector/`, `pathway/`, `mcp/`, `trace/`)                                                                                                                       |
| `reference`       | "Let me look something up"          | `cli/`, `model/`, `lifecycle/`, `yaml-schema/`                                                                                                                                            |
| `internals`       | "Show me how this is built"         | one per product (`map/`, `pathway/`, `outpost/`, `guide/`, `landmark/`, `summit/`), shared infrastructure (`codegen/`, `libcli/`, `librepl/`, `libskill/`, `terrain/`), and `operations/` |

## Audience Rules

Every sentence belongs to exactly one audience.

| Content                                                  | Audience              | Section                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| How to accomplish a task with the products               | Leadership, Engineers | Getting Started, Products |
| How to accomplish a task with the libraries (Gear)       | Builders, Agents      | Libraries                 |
| How to integrate with a running service                  | Builders, Agents      | Services                  |
| Entity definitions, CLI synopsis, YAML format            | All users             | Reference                 |
| Module structures, code paths, class names, `src/` paths | Contributors          | Internals                 |
| Architecture, data flow, formatter patterns              | Contributors          | Internals                 |

Never mix audiences on the same page. User-facing pages (Getting Started,
Products, Libraries, Reference) must never reference source file paths, class
names, or import statements.

## Writing Principles

**Product, Library, and Service tiers are task-oriented.** The folder name
signals audience, not page contents. A task may span multiple products or
libraries.

**Reference is lookup, not tutorial.** Structured, scannable — no prose
narrative.

**Link to existing artifacts, don't duplicate.** Published JSON Schema lives at
`/schema/json/` and RDF/SHACL at `/schema/rdf/` — link to them instead of
reproducing. Published SKILL.md files link to Product Guides, Library Guides,
and Reference markdown companions for progressive disclosure.

**Published skills use absolute URLs.** Published skills (`fit-*`) run on
external systems — use the full domain. Internal skills (`libs-*`, `kata-*`) may
use repo-relative paths.

**All tiers produce stable agent-fetchable URLs.** Every page gets a markdown
companion via `libdoc` at a predictable URL.

## Formatting Consistency

Formatting and terminology must be identical across pages.

**Repeating tables** — Canonical proficiency and behaviour maturity tables live
in the Authoring Standards guide; copies must match exactly.

**Field names** — Use the same tier vocabulary across disciplines and levels:

| Layer               | Names                                           | Used in                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Discipline tiers    | `coreSkills`, `supportingSkills`, `broadSkills` | Discipline YAML                         |
| Level proficiencies | `core`, `supporting`, `broad`                   | `baseSkillProficiencies` in levels.yaml |

Tier names in `baseSkillProficiencies` match discipline `<tier>Skills` arrays.

**Required/optional fields** — Verify against the JSON schema in
`products/map/schema/json/`. The schema's `required` array is the single source
of truth — do not guess from examples.

**Casing** — Table cells lowercase unless proper nouns or sentence starts.
Proficiency levels always lowercase (`awareness`). Behaviour maturities
lowercase with underscores (`role_modeling`). Entity field names in backticks
(`` `baseSkillProficiencies` ``).

## Repository Documentation

Documentation lives in two layers: repository root and website.

| File              | Purpose                                         | Audience         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `CLAUDE.md`       | Architecture context for coding agents          | Agents           |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | PR workflow, git conventions, quality, security | All contributors |
| `SECURITY.md`     | Vulnerability reporting                         | All contributors |

CONTRIBUTING.md is canonical for policies — CLAUDE.md references it. Onboarding
at `getting-started/contributors/`; operations at `internals/operations/`.

## Content Framing

Guides frame around the reader's progress, not product features.

| Instead of                            | Write                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Summit generates coverage heatmaps"  | "See which capabilities the team covers and where the gaps are"    |
| "Guide answers career questions"      | "When a promotion conversation ends with 'not yet,' get specifics" |

Banned JTBD vocabulary in guides: job, hire, fire, trigger, forces, compete.

## Layouts

| Layout    | Use for                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `product` | Section index pages (Getting Started, Guides, Reference, Internals) — grid of cards |
| _(none)_  | Leaf pages — prose with table of contents                                           |
