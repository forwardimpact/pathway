# Switching Interview

A **JTBD switching interview**: an agent, briefed only with a persona, tries
to get a chosen Job To Be Done done using a Forward Impact product they meet
cold at the public website. The agent is isolated with no monorepo access.
You run in the monorepo root with `JTBD.md`, the synthetic `data/` from
`fit-terrain build`, the `supabase` CLI, and project context — use them to
stage, craft, and verify, but never leak.

## When to Use

- You are running the `kata-interview` workflow.
- The task may include `Product:` and/or `Job:` overrides; otherwise pick.

This skill is not part of scheduled runs.

## LLM Availability

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is in the shell — `libconfig` reads it. LLM-backed
products (Guide, Outpost) work zero-config; if the agent asks for a key,
that is a **bug**. Do not tell the agent the key is pre-configured.

## Checklists

<read_do_checklist goal="Protect the interview before briefing the agent">

- [ ] Persona identity drawn from synthetic content (per Step 4) — not invented.
- [ ] Persona situation drawn from the chosen JTBD entry (per Step 4).
- [ ] Job text appears only in Ask 2 — never in `CLAUDE.md`.
- [ ] No product names in the persona file or in supervisor-authored Ask templates; product-named environment variables required by the production CLI are permitted in the agent's environment.
- [ ] Workspace staged per Step 3; `CLAUDE.md` written before Ask 1.
- [ ] No leaks of monorepo internals, skills, or pre-configured tokens.
- [ ] Do not fix problems for the agent — friction is the signal.

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Close the interview cleanly">

- [ ] Session concluded after filing issues and writing the report.
- [ ] Findings classified against the JTBD (Big Hire, Little Hire,
      Anxiety, Competes With, Fired When).
- [ ] Each actionable finding filed as a GitHub issue naming the job.
- [ ] Memory log appended for the week.

## Process

### Step 0: Read Memory

Per the agent profile: own summary, current week's log, teammates'
summaries. Bias product selection toward products not interviewed recently.

### Step 1: Pick the Product

If the task includes `Product:`, use it. Otherwise pick one of the products
under `products/` that has a `<job>` entry in `JTBD.md`.

### Step 2: Pick the Job

Read `JTBD.md`. Find every `<job>` entry whose **Big Hire** or **Little
Hire** line names the chosen product (e.g. `→ **Guide, Landmark**`). If the
task includes `Job:`, match it against the `goal=` attribute; otherwise
pick one. Record the full block: `user`, `goal`, Trigger, Big Hire, Little
Hire, Competes With, Forces (Push, Pull, Habit, Anxiety), Fired When.

### Step 3: Stage the Agent Workspace

The workflow ran `bunx fit-terrain build` and installed `supabase`.
Copy the subset the chosen product needs into `$AGENT_CWD`:

| Product          | Stage into `$AGENT_CWD`                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Guide, Outpost   | nothing                                                                                                                                            |
| Pathway          | `data/pathway/`                                                                                                                                    |
| Map              | `data/pathway/` and `data/activity/`                                                                                                               |
| Landmark         | `data/pathway/` and `data/activity/`; substrate (`auth.users` for all humans, schema, seed, smoke) staged by the workflow's `Substrate stage` step |
| Summit           | `data/pathway/` and `data/activity/raw/activity/summit.yaml` (as `summit.yaml` at root)                                                            |

Use `cp -r data/pathway "$AGENT_CWD/data/pathway"` and similar.

### Step 3a: Pick the Persona (Landmark only)

For **Landmark**, the workflow already brought up the substrate. Before
`CLAUDE.md`, pick a persona and seal identity:

1. `bunx fit-map substrate roster --format json` lists candidates
   (`email`, `discipline`, `level`, `manager_email`, `snapshot_id`,
   `item_id`).
2. Pick using **memory diversification** (skip personas in your last 5
   log entries) and **JTBD-role alignment** (`discipline`/`level`;
   `track` is informational).
3. `bunx fit-map substrate issue --email <picked> --cwd "$AGENT_CWD"
   --stash "$RUNNER_TEMP/.persona-jwt"` writes `.env`, `.substrate.json`,
   and a workflow-private JWT copy (mode 0600 on all three). You never
   see the JWT bytes; the agent has no `$RUNNER_TEMP` access.

If either verb exits non-zero, write a diagnostic naming the verb and
exit the skill — do not proceed to Step 4.

### Step 4: Craft the Persona

Write `$AGENT_CWD/CLAUDE.md`. The persona file carries **who** and **the
situation** — never the job. Two sources:

- **Identity** (name, team, manager, teammates, repos, recent project,
  company facts) — from the installation's synthetic content. This
  monorepo: `data/synthetic/story.dsl` and `prose-cache.json`.
- **Situation** (Trigger, Forces, Competes With) — from the chosen JTBD
  entry, rephrased into the persona's voice.

Excluded: goal sentence, Big Hire, Little Hire, Fired-When, product name.
Fired-When stays with you for Step 8 classification.

Template: [`references/persona-template.md`](references/persona-template.md).
Worked examples: [`references/example-personas.md`](references/example-personas.md).

### Step 5: Initiate the Session

Hand off in **two `Ask` calls** so persona and job both surface inline in
the trace. **Ask 1** opens with an introduction prompt; the agent's
`Answer` brings the persona, Trigger, and Forces inline. **Ask 2**
delivers the job (Big Hire + Little Hire as the persona's own want); the
website URL is in the Ask 2 template.

Templates and worked examples:
[`references/job-handoff.md`](references/job-handoff.md). If the task
carries steering not matching `Product:` / `Job:`, append it to Ask 2.

### Step 6: Supervise

| Agent State              | Your Response                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Making progress          | Short encouragement                        |
| Stuck on a specific step | Answer the specific question, in character |
| Going down a dead end    | Nudge toward the documented path           |
| Looping without progress | Targeted guidance                          |
| Job done or abandoned    | Proceed to Step 7                          |

Short reply messages, not further `Ask` calls — only Step 5 uses two Asks.
Use monorepo access to verify observations, but never feed verification
back to the agent.

### Step 7: Transition to Post-Interview

Once done or abandoned, stop sending work and proceed to Steps 8–9 in
the same turn. Conclude only after filing issues and writing the report.

### Step 8: Capture Findings

Review the agent's output. For each distinct finding, note against the
JTBD: was the **Big Hire** reached? **Little Hire** experienced? Did
**Anxiety** land? Did **Competes With** look more attractive? Did any
**Fired When** condition surface?

Classify each for action:

| Category            | Criteria                              | Action                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Bug**             | Crashes, errors, wrong output         | Create bug issue      |
| **Product-aligned** | Missing feature serving the vision    | Create feature issue  |
| **Documentation**   | Unclear, missing, or outdated docs    | Create docs issue     |
| **Out of scope**    | Not actionable or outside the product | Skip — note in report |

For each actionable finding: extract; search for duplicates; create a new
issue or comment on a matching one (templates in
`../kata-product-issue/references/templates.md` § New Issues from User
Testing) naming the JTBD job (`<user>: <goal>`) in the body; add the
finding to the report table with its issue number.

### Step 9: Report

Final summary: product and job; whether the persona got it done; which JTBD
forces materialised; table of findings and issues created or updated.

## Memory: what to record

Append to the current week's log: product interviewed; job (`<user>: <goal>`);
outcome (done / abandoned / partial); forces observed
(Push/Pull/Habit/Anxiety/Competes/Fired); issue numbers + categories.
Append one metrics row per run to `wiki/metrics/{skill}/` per
`references/metrics.md`. See KATA.md § Metrics for recording eligibility.
