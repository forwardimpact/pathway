# Terrain DSL

Terrain files define a complete synthetic environment. This monorepo's terrain
DSL is at `data/synthetic/story.dsl`. A minimal reference DSL ships with
libsyntheticgen at `libraries/libsyntheticgen/data/default.dsl` for quick
testing; projects provide their own DSL file.

### Top-Level Blocks

```dsl
terrain Name {
  domain "example.dev"
  industry "technology"
  seed 42

  org hq { ... }
  department engineering { ... }
  team backend { ... }
  people { ... }
  project alpha { ... }
  snapshots { ... }
  scenario launch_push { ... }
  framework { ... }
  content guide_html { ... }
  content basecamp_markdown { ... }
}
```

### Key Blocks

**org / department / team** — Organizational hierarchy with headcounts,
managers, and repo assignments.

**people** — Count, name theme, level distribution, discipline distribution.

**project** — Cross-team initiatives with timelines and prose topics.

**snapshots** — GetDX snapshot generation (quarterly intervals).

**scenario** — Time-bounded effects on teams (commit volume, DX driver
trajectories, evidence generation).

**framework** — Full pathway framework: levels, capabilities with skills,
behaviours, disciplines with skill tiers, tracks, drivers, and stages.

**content** — Output content blocks specifying article/blog/FAQ counts, persona
configurations, and briefing counts.
