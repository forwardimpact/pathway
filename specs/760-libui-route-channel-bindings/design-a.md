# Design 760-a — Shared invocation surfaces for LibUI and LibCLI

Spec 760 collapses pathway's three route↔CLI↔graph bindings into reusable
`@forwardimpact/libui` exports and converges handler input on a single
`InvocationContext` contract that libui and libcli both produce. This design
names the components, the public-API surface in each library, and the dispatch
sequence — then records the architectural choices and their rejected
alternatives.

`page` (web) and the libcli subcommand handler (CLI) play the same role on each
surface: dispatcher → calls the shared presenter → renders its returned view.
Neither contains capability logic; both are thin per-surface adapters around a
single `present(ctx)` function.

## Dispatch sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant URL as window.location
  participant Router as createBoundRouter
  participant Desc as descriptor
  participant Page as descriptor.page
  participant Pres as shared present(ctx)
  participant Bar as createCommandBar
  participant LD as createJsonLdScript

  URL->>Router: hashchange "/skill/testing?json=1"
  Router->>Desc: match → args { id: "testing" }
  Router->>Router: parse query → options
  Router->>Router: ctx = freezeInvocationContext({ data, args, options })
  Router->>Page: page(ctx, { vocabularyBase })
  Page->>Pres: present(ctx)
  Pres-->>Page: view
  Page->>LD: createJsonLdScript(descriptor.graph, body, { vocabularyBase })
  LD->>Desc: graph(ctx, vocabularyBase) → IRI
  LD-->>Page: <script>
  Page-->>Router: rendered (DOM mounted)
  Router->>Bar: activeRoute = { descriptor, ctx }
  Bar->>Desc: cli(ctx) → "npx fit-pathway skill testing"
```

The CLI surface follows the same shape: libcli parses argv, builds
`ctx = freezeInvocationContext({ data, args: namedMap, options })`, dispatches
the subcommand handler — which calls `present(ctx) → view` and hands the view to
libcli's surface formatter for stdout rendering. **One presenter per
capability**, exercised by both surfaces against synthetic contexts with no DOM
or stdout scaffolding.

`vocabularyBase` flows from `createBoundRouter`'s option through the dispatcher
into `page(ctx, { vocabularyBase })`; the page forwards it to the JSON-LD
helper. The base is not part of `ctx` (it is a host-level constant, not
per-invocation input) and not on `activeRoute` (the bar never needs it).

Channels behave as follows when absent:

- **No `cli`** — descriptor omits the slot; `createCommandBar` renders empty
  text, never throws or shows a stale command from the prior route.
- **No `graph`** — descriptor omits the slot; `createJsonLdScript` returns
  `null`; the caller skips mounting.

| **D1**  | `InvocationContext` location | Duplicated typedef + `freezeInvocationContext` helper in both libraries; a shape-equivalence test in each library catches drift                                                                                                                                                           | (a) New shared package `@forwardimpact/libinvoke`; (b) host in `libtype`                                                 | (a) introduces a third package to publish/version for ~40 lines of JSDoc plus a 10-line freeze helper; (b) `libtype` is protobuf-generated types — typedef does not fit its purpose and codegen would couple unrelated build chains. JSDoc is documentation, so duplication is type-safe; the equivalence test bounds drift at `bun run check` time.        |
| **D2**  | Descriptor API shape         | Sibling primitive `defineRoute({ pattern, page, cli?, graph? })` returning a plain descriptor; `boundRouter.register(descriptor)` mounts it; `boundRouter.routes()` enumerates them                                                                                                       | (a) Extend `router.on(pattern, options)` with optional channels; (b) `router.on(pattern, page, { cli, graph })` overload | Both overloads break `router.on()`'s `(pattern, handler)` invariant and conflate declaration with registration. A first-class descriptor that the router enumerates lets a future graph-walking agent surface read the registry without rendering — the agent-shaped property the spec calls out.                                                           |
| **D3**  | Top-bar surface              | Full component `createCommandBar(router, opts)` plus the `router.activeRoute` reactive as an escape hatch                                                                                                                                                                                 | (a) Hook-only "command provider" that products wrap into their own bar                                                   | Hook-only re-introduces the duplication the spec exists to remove — Landmark and Summit would each rebuild the same Safari-style bar. The reactive escape hatch covers products that want a non-bar treatment (status line, agent surface) without forcing a hook-only baseline.                                                                            |
| **D4**  | JSON-LD helper signature     | `createJsonLdScript(graphFormatter, body, { vocabularyBase })` — the helper invokes the formatter; the caller never mints an IRI                                                                                                                                                          | (a) `createJsonLdScript(iri, body)` — caller mints the IRI then passes it as a string                                    | Caller-mints invites a page to bypass the descriptor and forge its own IRI, which is exactly the drift mode the spec is closing. Single round-trip through the descriptor's Graph channel keeps `@id` and the registry in lockstep.                                                                                                                         |
| **D5**  | Vocabulary-base wiring       | Optional option on `createBoundRouter({ vocabularyBase })`; the router passes it as an explicit second argument to `descriptor.graph` and as a `page`-handler argument that the page forwards to `createJsonLdScript`. Required only when the host registers any Graph-channel descriptor | (a) Per-call argument the page mints itself; (b) hardcode `RDF_PREFIXES.fit` from libgraph inside libui                  | (a) diffuses the base across pages — the centralisation the spec wants is undone; (b) creates a libui→libgraph dependency for one string and prevents a non-pathway host from using a different vocabulary. Pathway's bootstrap reads `RDF_PREFIXES.fit` once and passes it in; the linkage to `libgraph` stays explicit at the host call site, unenforced. |
| **D6**  | libcli `args` shape          | Subcommand definitions gain `args: string[]` (declared positional names); the command builder maps argv positionals to a named map keyed by those names before invoking the handler                                                                                                       | (a) Keep array, expose `argNames` separately for callers to zip themselves                                               | Keeping the array forces every handler to remember positional order — drift-prone, and inconsistent with the web side which has named params from the route pattern. The named map is what the spec mandates and matches the web-side route-pattern parameters.                                                                                             |
| **D7**  | Host runtime extras          | Folded into `ctx.data` by host bootstrap before invocation; libui and libcli have no third channel                                                                                                                                                                                        | (a) Add a `runtime` channel on `InvocationContext` (`{ data, args, options, runtime }`)                                  | A third channel re-creates the surface dispatch the contract is removing — `dataDir` belongs only to CLI, `templateLoader` only to web. Folding is the host's responsibility and is documented in the libui guide; `data` remains the single host-supplied dependency channel.                                                                              |
| **D8**  | Frozenness enforcement       | `freezeInvocationContext(raw)` runtime helper exported by both libraries; deep-freezes context, `args`, `options`, and any `Array` values inside `options`                                                                                                                                | (a) Document the invariant; trust producers to call `Object.freeze` themselves                                           | The spec mandates handlers MAY assume immutability without checking — without a runtime helper the invariant is folklore and a future producer (graph-walking agent surface) lands without it. The helper is ~10 lines; success-criterion 2 asserts on it.                                                                                                  |
| **D9**  | ESLint enforcement placement | A repo-root ESLint rule (`eslint.config.js` in this monorepo) flags any newly-introduced handler whose first parameter is a `params` object or a destructured `{ data, args, options }` literal; scoped to `libraries/libui/`, `libraries/libcli/`, and `products/pathway/`               | (a) Three per-package rules; (b) test-only assertion via AST inspection                                                  | (a) triplicates rule maintenance for one invariant; (b) AST-in-test catches handlers but doesn't catch refactors that re-introduce the old shapes outside test coverage. A single root rule with three path scopes is the smallest enforcement surface that satisfies spec criterion line 333.                                                              |

## Public API surface (additions and changes)

`@forwardimpact/libui` (additions):

- `RouteDescriptor` — typedef:
  `{ pattern: string, page: (ctx: InvocationContext, { vocabularyBase?: string }) => void, cli?: (ctx: InvocationContext) => string, graph?: (ctx: InvocationContext, vocabularyBase: string) => string }`.
- `defineRoute(spec) → RouteDescriptor`.
- `createBoundRouter({ vocabularyBase?, onNotFound, onError, renderError }) → BoundRouter`
  with `register(descriptor)`, `routes()`, `start()`, `stop()`,
  `navigate(path)`, and an `activeRoute` reactive carrying
  `{ descriptor, ctx } | null`.
- `createCommandBar(router, { mountInto: HTMLElement }) → { destroy }`.
- `createJsonLdScript(graphFormatter, body, { vocabularyBase }) → HTMLScriptElement | null`.
- `freezeInvocationContext(raw) → InvocationContext` plus the
  `InvocationContext` typedef.

`@forwardimpact/libcli` (changes):

- Subcommand definition gains `args: string[]` (declared positional names).
- Handler signature: `(ctx: InvocationContext) → void | Promise<void>` (replaces
  today's `({ data, args, options })`).
- New exports: `freezeInvocationContext` and the `InvocationContext` typedef.

Existing libui and libcli exports are preserved unchanged: `createRouter` (the
today-router) stays for products that don't opt into bindings;
`createBoundRouter` is additive. `createBoundRouter`'s
`start/stop/navigate/onNotFound/onError/ renderError` are the same surface
`createRouter` already exposes — no new router responsibilities are introduced.

## Pathway adoption shape

- Three files removed: `lib/cli-command.js`, `components/top-bar.js`, and the
  `@id`-minting + `<script>`-construction halves of `formatters/json-ld.js`
  (per-entity body builders remain — `Skill.proficiencyDescriptions`,
  `Discipline.coreSkills`, etc. — owned by the product).
- `main.js`'s `setupRoutes()` becomes a list of `defineRoute(...)` calls plus
  one `boundRouter.register(descriptor)` per route. Per-entity CLI command
  strings and graph IRIs live as inline arrow functions on the descriptor —
  drift-resistant because they sit beside the URL pattern.
- Every page in `src/pages/*.js` and every shared presenter in
  `src/formatters/<entity>/shared.js` takes a single `ctx: InvocationContext`
  argument; no `getState()` reaches and no `window.location.hash` parsing.
- `commands/command-factory.js` builds an `InvocationContext` from
  `{ data, argMap, options }` (where `argMap` is keyed by the subcommand's
  declared positional names) and dispatches to the same shared presenter the
  descriptor's `page` invokes.

The vendored libui primitives in `products/pathway/src/lib/` (router-core,
render, …) stay imported by relative path; the new descriptor API is imported
from `@forwardimpact/libui`. Whether to also retire pathway's vendored
primitives is a plan-phase decision — the design's correctness does not depend
on it.

## Presenter divergence audit (per spec § Notes)

Pathway today has separate web pages (`src/pages/<entity>.js`) and CLI handlers
(`src/commands/<entity>.js`). Both already converge downstream on the same
`view`-shape: web pages render through `*ToDOM` formatters and CLI handlers
render through `formatDetail` formatters, but the `view` consumed by both is
produced by the entity's `presentDetail` and shared formatter — there is one
view shape per capability. No surface-specific divergence requires reconciling
the contract or extending it with a documented surface-specific specialisation.
The libcli list/validate modes (`--list`, `--validate`) operate on entity
collections, not on a single capability's view, and remain libcli-only command
behaviours rather than shared presenter outputs.

## Out of scope (per spec)

- Backwards-compat shims, parallel re-exports, or `params`-only handler aliases.
- Adding the descriptor API to Landmark or Summit web UIs.
- Changes to `libgraph`'s `RDF_PREFIXES`.
- Reverse mapping (CLI string → URL, graph IRI → URL).
- Server-side JSON-LD rendering.
- A graph-walking agent surface (the contract is shaped to admit one later; the
  producer is not in this spec).
