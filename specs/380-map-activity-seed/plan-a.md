# Plan A — Map Activity Seed

Implements spec 380: a single `fit-map activity seed` command that populates the
activity database from synthetic data, plus parser consolidation, DSL
validation, and an integration test.

## Approach

The seed command is a thin orchestrator — it reads local files, uploads them to
Supabase Storage via the existing `storeRaw()` function, then runs the existing
transform and verify pipeline. No new database logic; we reuse the ELT pipeline
end-to-end.

Parser consolidation extracts the duplicated `parseYamlPeople`/`parseCsv` into a
new shared module under `products/map/activity/`. Both the CLI validator and the
Supabase edge function import from it. The shared module avoids Node-only imports
(`fs`) so it works under Deno.

DSL validation is a parse-time check: when `framework.levels` and
`people.distribution` both exist, distribution keys must be a subset of level
IDs.

## Parts

This plan is decomposed into four independently executable parts:

| Part | Scope | Dependencies |
|------|-------|--------------|
| [01](plan-a-01.md) | Parser consolidation | None |
| [02](plan-a-02.md) | DSL distribution key validation | None |
| [03](plan-a-03.md) | `seed` command and `just` targets | Part 01 (uses shared parser) |
| [04](plan-a-04.md) | Integration test | Part 01, 03 |

## Cross-cutting concerns

- **Deno compatibility**: The shared parser module must not import `fs` or other
  Node-only modules. It receives content strings, not file paths. The edge
  function's `deno.json` already maps `yaml` → `npm:yaml@2`, so the bare `yaml`
  import works in both runtimes.
- **Idempotency**: `storeRaw()` already uses `upsert: true`. The transform
  pipeline uses upsert with `onConflict` keys. Running seed twice produces the
  same state.
- **Error reporting**: Follow the existing `{count, errors}` pattern used by all
  transform functions. The seed command collects results from each phase and
  reports them together.

## Open question resolutions

- **Seed in `--help`**: Show the command with `[internal]` label. Hiding it
  completely is fragile and makes discoverability worse for contributors.
- **Docker detection**: Use `docker info --format '{{.ID}}' 2>/dev/null` with a
  3-second timeout. Fast, silent on failure, returns exit 1 when Docker daemon is
  not running.
- **Shared parser import path**: The Supabase edge function at
  `supabase/functions/_shared/activity/transform/people.js` imports the shared
  module via a relative path (`../../../../activity/parse-people.js`). The
  `deno.json` already maps `yaml` to `npm:yaml@2`, so the shared module's
  `import { parse } from "yaml"` resolves in both Node and Deno.

## Execution

Parts 01 and 02 are independent — launch as concurrent `staff-engineer`
sub-agents. Part 03 depends on 01 (the seed command uses the shared parser to
validate the roster locally before uploading). Part 04 depends on 01 and 03.

```
01 ──┐
     ├── 03 ── 04
02 ──┘
```

All parts are `staff-engineer` work (code and infrastructure). The operations
doc update in part 03 is minimal (adding a `seed` entry to the existing activity
section) and does not need a separate documentation agent.
