# Plan A — Landmark Product

Implementation plan for [spec.md](./spec.md) (spec 080).

## Approach

Landmark is a read-only CLI analysis layer over Map's activity schema. It has
one very close sibling in the repo — **Summit** (`products/summit/`) — which
already:

- Uses the same `libcli` + `--format text|json|markdown` conventions Landmark
  needs.
- Imports Map's pure loader (`createDataLoader`) and activity queries under the
  same subpath aliases Landmark will consume.
- Ships a Supabase client factory (`src/lib/supabase.js`) that mirrors Map's
  env-var contract and handles graceful unavailability.
- Exports `computeGrowthAlignment` — the function Landmark's `health` view
  imports directly.

The strategy is therefore: **scaffold Landmark as a near-twin of Summit**,
reusing its CLI bootstrap pattern, Supabase factory, `resolveFormat` helper,
formatter layout, and test harness. Anything that already works in Summit gets
copied, not rediscovered. Divergence from Summit happens only where the
products actually differ (Landmark's per-view audience model, its Map activity
queries, its evidence-based views).

### Key architectural decisions

1. **Mirror Summit's package layout.** `products/landmark/{bin,src,test}` with
   `src/{commands,formatters,lib}`. Commands live under `src/commands/<name>.js`
   and are dispatched from `bin/fit-landmark.js` through `libcli.createCli`.
   Shared helpers (`resolveDataDir`, `loadMapData`, `resolveFormat`,
   `createLandmarkClient`) live in `src/lib/`.

2. **Summit is a declared dependency with optional runtime.** Spec 090 is
   `done` and `@forwardimpact/summit` already exports `computeGrowthAlignment`
   from the package root (synchronous function). Landmark lists Summit in its
   `dependencies` so contributors and default npm installs always have it.
   The spec still specifies a graceful-degrade path when Summit is missing,
   so Landmark loads Summit through a dynamic `import()` wrapper and falls
   back to a no-recommendations view if the module is absent. This resolves
   the tension between "hard dep in the manifest" and "optional at runtime":
   the manifest is truthful, the wrapper makes the spec's empty-state
   enforceable in tests, and real users always get recommendations.

3. **Supabase client is created lazily per command.** Commands that need
   activity data call `createLandmarkClient()` from `src/lib/supabase.js` (a
   thin clone of Summit's factory). Commands that only need framework data
   (`marker`) do not open a client at all.

4. **Audience flags are per-command, not global.** Spec's audience model maps
   to `--email` (engineer scope), `--manager` (manager/director scope). The
   privacy rule (director aggregation vs manager specificity) is encoded per
   command. No global `--audience` flag — command options are sufficient.

5. **Empty states are data, not exceptions.** Every command produces a
   well-formed result object with a `meta.emptyState` string when a data
   source is missing. Formatters render the empty-state message verbatim; JSON
   output always includes the field. This keeps the "explain in terms the user
   can act on" rule (spec line 571) enforceable in tests.

6. **Markers are authored in starter data as part of this plan.** Part 02 adds
   marker definitions to `delivery.yaml` and `reliability.yaml`. Part 03 adds
   additional drivers (`reliability`, `cognitive_load`) to `drivers.yaml` so
   the starter demonstrates multi-driver `health` views. These changes are
   scoped to the starter template and are independent from external
   installations, which must still author their own markers and drivers.

7. **New Map tables (`getdx_snapshot_comments`, `getdx_initiatives`) are
   authored here**, inside Parts 04 and 05. Those parts touch
   `products/map/supabase/` to extend the extract/transform pipeline, add
   migrations, export new query modules, and wire them through
   `products/map/package.json`. Landmark consumes the new queries in the same
   part to keep each feature end-to-end verifiable.

### Dependency graph

```
Part 01 ─────────────┬──→ Part 02 ──→ Part 03 ──┬──→ Part 04 ──┐
(scaffolding)        │   (evidence    (health)  │   (comments  │
                     │    helpers)              │    + voice)  │
                     │                          │              ├──→ Part 06
                     └──→ Part 05 ──────────────┘              │    (docs)
                         (initiatives)                         │
                                                               │
                         Part 05 also joins  ─────────────────┘
                         before Part 06
```

True DAG:

- **Part 01** is the strict prerequisite for everything.
- **Part 02** depends on Part 01. It introduces `evidence-helpers.js` which
  Parts 03 and 04 reuse.
- **Part 03** depends on Part 02 (evidence helpers) and creates
  `src/commands/health.js`. Both Parts 04 and 05 later mutate this file.
- **Part 04** depends on Part 03. It adds the comments pipeline, ships
  `voice`, and adds a **comments section** to `health.js` and
  `formatters/health.js` via a clearly-named hook point (`// <comments
  section>` comment anchor) documented in Part 03.
- **Part 05** depends on Part 03. It adds the initiatives pipeline, ships
  `initiative list|show|impact`, and adds an **initiatives section** to
  `health.js` and `formatters/health.js` via a separate hook point (`//
  <initiatives section>`). Part 05 is required (not polish) because spec
  § Initiative tracking mandates the health-view integration.
- **Parts 04 and 05 can run in parallel** after Part 03 lands, because they
  touch disjoint sections of the same files. Part 03 pre-places the two
  hook-point comments so the two sequential edits are non-overlapping.
  Part 06 waits for both.
- **Part 06** depends on Parts 01–05. Documentation only.

### Blast radius

**Created (Part 01 baseline):**

- `products/landmark/package.json`
- `products/landmark/bin/fit-landmark.js`
- `products/landmark/src/index.js`
- `products/landmark/src/lib/{cli,supabase,context,empty-state}.js`
- `products/landmark/src/commands/{org,snapshot,marker}.js`
- `products/landmark/src/formatters/{index,org,snapshot,marker,shared}.js`
- `products/landmark/test/*.test.js`

**Modified (Part 01):**

- `package.json` (root) — add `products/landmark` to workspaces array
- `justfile` — add `landmark` target wrappers if present for other products
- No changes to Map or existing products in Part 01.

Parts 02–05 each list their own created/modified files in their part file.
Part 06 touches `website/`, `.claude/skills/`, and root docs.

### Risks

| Risk                                                                                                                        | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getdx_snapshot_team_scores.item_id` ↔ `drivers.yaml` id is an implicit contract                                            | Part 03 adds a validation step: when `health` runs, it cross-references the set of `item_id` values against loaded drivers and surfaces unknown items as a warning rather than silently dropping them.                    |
| Starter data has only 2 levels (`J040`, `J060`), so `readiness` at Level II produces "no higher level defined"              | Spec already anticipates this (§ Promotion readiness). Part 02's test covers both paths: Level I → Level II checklist, Level II → empty-state.                                                                             |
| `getEvidence({email})` joins via `github_artifacts.email` — confirms the join chain but assumes artifact rows exist         | Part 02 covers the empty-evidence case (no artifacts yet) by rendering the standard "No evidence data available" empty state. Test fixture uses an org_people row with no artifacts to prove the path.                    |
| Summit's `computeGrowthAlignment` signature could change                                                                    | Part 03 pins a compatible `@forwardimpact/summit` minor version in `products/landmark/package.json` and asserts the expected output shape in a unit test. A breaking change in Summit will be caught by CI.               |
| GetDX Initiatives API shape is unknown in advance (no existing code to copy)                                                | Part 05 defines the Initiatives API integration against a stub extract that stores raw responses. The migration + query can be written against the stub. Wiring the real endpoint is a one-line change once verified.    |
| Adding markers to starter capabilities is a breaking change for downstream installations that have their own marker schema | Starter markers are additive — existing capabilities keep their `proficiencyDescriptions` and simply gain a `markers` field. Since nobody currently defines markers, this cannot conflict with external installations.   |
| New Supabase migrations require coordinating with `just migrate`                                                            | Parts 04 and 05 use the Map migration conventions (single `.sql` file under `products/map/supabase/migrations/NNNN_*.sql`) and note the `just migrate` run step in their verification sections.                           |
| Dynamic `import("@forwardimpact/summit")` in Part 03 needs a test path that simulates "Summit missing"                      | Part 03's test uses `mock.module` or a controlled wrapper function (`loadSummit()`) injected into the command handler so that unit tests can pass `() => null` to exercise the graceful path without touching node_modules. |

### Execution

Route every part to **`staff-engineer`** except Part 06, which goes to
**`technical-writer`**. Plan execution is:

1. **Part 01** runs first in isolation (staff-engineer). Merge before
   starting any other part.
2. **Part 02** runs after Part 01 merges (staff-engineer). Its
   `evidence-helpers.js` is reused by Parts 03 and 04 so it must land first.
3. **Part 03** runs after Part 02 merges (staff-engineer). Part 03 creates
   `src/commands/health.js` and pre-places two anchor comments
   (`// <comments section>`, `// <initiatives section>`) so Parts 04 and 05
   can edit disjoint regions of the file without merge conflicts.
4. **Parts 04 and 05 run in parallel** (two concurrent staff-engineer
   sub-agents) after Part 03 merges. They touch disjoint sections of
   `health.js`/`formatters/health.js`, disjoint query modules in Map, and
   disjoint command files. The anchor-comment contract is mandatory.
5. **Part 06** runs after Parts 04 and 05 both merge (technical-writer). It
   needs the final command surface to write accurate documentation.

Each part includes its own verification steps (tests, CI, smoke test). Do not
chain parts past a failing verification.

### Cross-part conventions

All parts follow these shared conventions so they compose cleanly:

- **File naming:** commands at `products/landmark/src/commands/<name>.js`,
  formatters at `products/landmark/src/formatters/<name>.js`. One file per
  top-level command (`org`, `snapshot`, `evidence`, `health`, etc.). Subcommands
  (`snapshot list` vs `snapshot show`) dispatch inside the command file.
- **Command handler signature:** `async function run<Name>Command({ data, args,
  options, supabase, mapData })`, matching Summit's shape. `supabase` is
  `null` when the command did not open a client. `mapData` is the result of
  `loadMapData(dataDir)`.
- **Return shape:** every handler returns `{ view, meta }` where `view` is the
  command-specific data object and `meta` is `{ format, emptyState, warnings }`.
  The dispatcher in `bin/fit-landmark.js` passes this to the appropriate
  formatter.
- **Tests:** Node's built-in `node:test` and `node:assert`, mirroring Pathway
  and Summit. Test files at `products/landmark/test/<name>.test.js`. Use
  fixture objects for Map data and a stub Supabase client that returns seeded
  results; no real network calls.
- **Lint & format:** run `bun run check` inside `products/landmark/` after
  each part.
