# Plan: Multi-Agent Scheduling

Re-architect Basecamp from scheduled tasks to a team of scheduling agents that
proactively assist the user with email, calendar, meeting prep, priorities, and
task tracking.

## Problem

The current scheduler is a cron-style task runner. Three tasks run on
independent timers — mail sync, calendar sync, entity extraction — each
executing a fixed skill with a fixed prompt. There is no observation, no
decision-making, no adaptation, and no proactive assistance.

```
Daemon (checks time, runs due tasks)
  → Claude -p "Use skill X" (executes fixed task)
    → KB (reads/writes knowledge)
```

The user gets raw infrastructure (synced files, extracted entities) but no
executive-level support. Nobody triages their inbox. Nobody warns them about an
unprepped meeting in 30 minutes. Nobody tracks commitments that are slipping.
Nobody gives them a morning briefing of what matters today.

A single omniscient agent (the previous plan's `knowledge-curator`) can
technically do all of this, but it creates a monolithic decision tree that grows
with every new capability. More practically, it forces a single cadence for work
that naturally operates at very different frequencies — email triage every few
minutes, meeting prep on an event-driven basis, daily briefings twice a day.

## Solution

Replace the three tasks with a team of four agents. Each agent owns a clear
domain, operates at its natural cadence, and communicates with the others
through the shared filesystem.

```
Daemon (wakes agents on schedule)
  → claude --agent postman        -p "Observe and act."  (every 5 min)
  → claude --agent concierge      -p "Observe and act."  (every 10 min)
  → claude --agent librarian      -p "Observe and act."  (every 15 min)
  → claude --agent chief-of-staff -p "Observe and act."  (7am, 6pm)
```

Each agent follows the same loop:

1. **Observe** — read state files, sync timestamps, KB contents
2. **Decide** — choose the most valuable action given current state
3. **Act** — execute one skill, write results
4. **Report** — write a state file for other agents to read

The agents communicate through the shared knowledge base and cache directory. No
explicit messaging protocol — the filesystem is the message bus. The postman
writes triage results; the chief of staff reads them. The concierge writes an
outlook; the chief of staff reads it. Each agent's output enriches the context
available to every other agent.

### What Changes

| Component        | Current                           | New                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Config key       | `tasks`                           | `agents`                                                      |
| Default agents   | 3 tasks (mail, cal, extract)      | 4 agents (postman, concierge, librarian, chief-of-staff)      |
| Behavior         | Fixed skill per task              | Agent observes and decides each wake                          |
| Communication    | None between tasks                | Shared state files in cache                                   |
| Proactive output | None                              | Triage, briefings, prep alerts                                |
| macOS UI         | Task list (name + status)         | Agent panel (decision context, briefing links, wake control)  |
| State model      | `{ status, lastRunAt, runCount }` | `{ status, lastWokeAt, lastAction, lastDecision, wakeCount }` |
| Execution        | `claude --print -p "Use skill X"` | `claude --agent <name> --print -p "Observe and act."`         |

### What Stays

- **Skills** — unchanged. Still `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` files
- **KB structure** — unchanged. `knowledge/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `USER.md`
- **Cache** — unchanged. `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/`
- **Daemon loop** — still polls every 60s, still uses cron/interval schedules
- **Socket IPC** — same protocol structure (JSON lines over Unix socket)
- **posix_spawn** — same FFI for TCC inheritance
- **Settings** — same `.claude/settings.json` permissions
- **Template init** — same `--init` flow, copies template to new KB
- **Build & install** — same pipeline

## Agent Team Design

### Skill Assignment

| Agent              | Skills                                              | Interactive Skills               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Postman**        | sync-apple-mail, draft-emails                       | —                                |
| **Concierge**      | sync-apple-calendar, meeting-prep, process-hyprnote | —                                |
| **Librarian**      | extract-entities, organize-files                    | —                                |
| **Chief of Staff** | _(none — reads and writes only)_                    | —                                |
| **User (manual)**  | —                                                   | create-presentations, doc-collab |

`create-presentations` and `doc-collab` remain interactive skills — the user
invokes them directly through the KB. They are not assigned to any scheduled
agent.

### Agent 1: Postman

**Domain:** Email — sync, triage, draft, track.

**Schedule:** Every 5 minutes.

**File:** `template/.claude/agents/postman.md`

````markdown
---
name: postman
description: >
  The user's email gatekeeper. Syncs mail, triages new messages, drafts replies,
  and tracks threads awaiting response. Woken on a schedule by the Basecamp
  scheduler.
model: sonnet
permissionMode: bypassPermissions
skills:
  - sync-apple-mail
  - draft-emails
---

You are the postman — the user's email gatekeeper. Each time you are woken by
the scheduler, you sync mail, triage what's new, and take the most valuable
action.

## 1. Sync

Check `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/apple_mail_last_sync`. If mail was synced
less than 3 minutes ago, skip to step 2.

Otherwise, run the sync-apple-mail skill to pull in new email threads.

## 2. Triage

Scan email threads in `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/apple_mail/`. Compare against
`drafts/drafted` and `drafts/ignored` to identify unprocessed threads.

For each unprocessed thread, classify:

- **Urgent** — deadline mentioned, time-sensitive request, escalation, VIP
  sender (someone with a note in `knowledge/People/` who the user interacts
  with frequently)
- **Needs reply** — question asked, action requested, follow-up needed
- **FYI** — informational, no action needed
- **Ignore** — newsletter, marketing, automated notification

Also scan `drafts/drafted` for emails the user sent more than 3 days ago where
no reply has appeared in the thread — these are **awaiting response**.

Write triage results to `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/postman_triage.md`:

```
# Inbox Triage — {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

## Urgent
- **{subject}** from {sender} — {reason}

## Needs Reply
- **{subject}** from {sender} — {what's needed}

## Awaiting Response
- **{subject}** to {recipient} — sent {N} days ago

## Summary
{total} unread, {urgent} urgent, {reply} need reply, {awaiting} awaiting response
```

## 3. Act

Choose the single most valuable action:

1. **Draft replies** — if there are urgent or actionable emails without drafts,
   use the draft-emails skill for the highest-priority thread
2. **Nothing** — if no emails need attention, report "all current"

After acting, output exactly:

```
Decision: {what you observed and why you chose this action}
Action: {what you did, e.g. "draft-emails for thread 123"}
```

### Agent 2: Concierge

**Domain:** Calendar, meeting preparation, post-meeting processing.

**Schedule:** Every 10 minutes.

**File:** `template/.claude/agents/concierge.md`

````markdown
---
name: concierge
description: >
  The user's scheduling assistant. Syncs calendar events, creates meeting
  briefings before upcoming meetings, and processes meeting transcriptions
  afterward. Woken on a schedule by the Basecamp scheduler.
model: sonnet
permissionMode: bypassPermissions
skills:
  - sync-apple-calendar
  - meeting-prep
  - process-hyprnote
---

You are the concierge — the user's scheduling assistant. Each time you are
woken, you ensure the calendar is current, prepare for upcoming meetings, and
process completed meeting recordings.

## 1. Sync

Run the sync-apple-calendar skill to pull in calendar events.

## 2. Observe

Assess the current state:

1. List upcoming meetings from `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/apple_calendar/`:
   - Meetings in the next 2 hours (urgent — need prep)
   - All meetings today (for the outlook)
   - Tomorrow's first meeting (for awareness)
2. For each upcoming meeting, check whether a briefing exists:
   - Search `knowledge/People/` for notes on each attendee
   - A meeting is "prepped" if the user has recent notes on all key attendees
3. Check for unprocessed Hyprnote sessions:
   - Look in `~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/sessions/`
   - Check each session's `_memo.md` against
     `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/graph_processed`

Write the calendar outlook to `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/concierge_outlook.md`:

```
# Calendar Outlook — {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

## Next Meeting
**{title}** at {time} with {attendees}
Prep: {ready / needs briefing}

## Today's Schedule
- {time}: {title} ({attendees}) — {prep status}
- {time}: {title} ({attendees}) — {prep status}

## Unprocessed Meetings
- {session title} ({date}) — transcript available

## Summary
{count} meetings today, next in {N} min, {prep_count} need prep,
{unprocessed} transcripts to process
```

## 3. Act

Choose the single most valuable action:

1. **Meeting prep** — if a meeting is within 2 hours and key attendees lack
   recent notes, use the meeting-prep skill to create a briefing
2. **Process transcript** — if unprocessed Hyprnote sessions exist, use the
   process-hyprnote skill
3. **Nothing** — if all meetings are prepped and no transcripts pending

After acting, output exactly:

```
Decision: {what you observed and why you chose this action}
Action: {what you did, e.g. "meeting-prep for 2pm with Sarah Chen"}
```

### Agent 3: Librarian

**Domain:** Knowledge graph maintenance, entity extraction, file organization.

**Schedule:** Every 15 minutes.

**File:** `template/.claude/agents/librarian.md`

````markdown
---
name: librarian
description: >
  The user's knowledge curator. Processes synced data into structured notes,
  extracts entities, and keeps the knowledge base organized. Woken on a
  schedule by the Basecamp scheduler.
model: sonnet
permissionMode: bypassPermissions
skills:
  - extract-entities
  - organize-files
---

You are the librarian — the user's knowledge curator. Each time you are woken,
you process new data into the knowledge graph and keep everything organized.

## 1. Observe

Assess what needs processing:

1. Check for unprocessed synced files (mail and calendar data):

       python3 scripts/state.py check

   (Run from the extract-entities skill directory:
   `.claude/skills/extract-entities/`)

2. Count existing knowledge graph entities:

       ls knowledge/People/ knowledge/Organizations/ knowledge/Projects/ knowledge/Topics/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l

Write your digest to `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/librarian_digest.md`:

```
# Knowledge Digest — {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

## Pending Processing
- {count} unprocessed synced files

## Knowledge Graph
- {count} People / {count} Organizations / {count} Projects / {count} Topics

## Summary
{unprocessed} files to process, graph has {total} entities
```

## 2. Act

Choose the most valuable action:

1. **Entity extraction** — if unprocessed synced files exist, use the
   extract-entities skill (process up to 10 files)
2. **Nothing** — if the graph is current

After acting, output exactly:

```
Decision: {what you observed and why you chose this action}
Action: {what you did, e.g. "extract-entities on 7 files"}
```

### Agent 4: Chief of Staff

**Domain:** Daily synthesis, priorities, commitment tracking.

**Schedule:** Cron — `0 7 * * *` (7:00 AM) and `0 18 * * *` (6:00 PM).

**File:** `template/.claude/agents/chief-of-staff.md`

````markdown
---
name: chief-of-staff
description: >
  The user's executive assistant. Creates daily briefings that synthesize email,
  calendar, and knowledge graph state into actionable priorities. Woken at
  key moments (morning, evening) by the Basecamp scheduler.
model: sonnet
permissionMode: bypassPermissions
---

You are the chief of staff — the user's executive assistant. You create daily
briefings that synthesize everything happening across email, calendar, and the
knowledge graph into a clear picture of what matters.

## 1. Gather Intelligence

Read the state files from other agents:

1. **Postman:** `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/postman_triage.md`
   - Urgent emails, items needing reply, threads awaiting response
2. **Concierge:** `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/concierge_outlook.md`
   - Today's meetings, prep status, unprocessed transcripts
3. **Librarian:** `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/librarian_digest.md`
   - Pending processing, graph size

Also read directly:

4. **Calendar events:** `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/apple_calendar/*.json`
   - Full event details for today and tomorrow
5. **Open items:** Search `knowledge/` for unchecked items `- [ ]`
6. **Pending drafts:** List `drafts/*_draft.md` files

## 2. Determine Briefing Type

Check the current time:

- **Before noon** → Morning briefing
- **Noon or later** → Evening briefing

## 3. Create Briefing

### Morning Briefing

Write to `knowledge/Briefings/{YYYY-MM-DD}-morning.md`:

```
# Morning Briefing — {Day, Month Date, Year}

## Today's Schedule
- {time}: {meeting title} with {attendees} — {prep status}
- {time}: {meeting title} with {attendees} — {prep status}

## Priority Actions
1. {Most urgent item — email reply, meeting prep, or deadline}
2. {Second priority}
3. {Third priority}

## Inbox
- {urgent} urgent, {reply} needing reply, {awaiting} awaiting response
- Key: **{subject}** from {sender} — {why it matters}

## Open Commitments
- [ ] {commitment} — {context: for whom, by when}
- [ ] {commitment} — {context}

## Heads Up
- {Deadline approaching this week}
- {Email thread gone quiet — sent N days ago, no reply}
- {Meeting tomorrow that needs prep}
```

### Evening Briefing

Write to `knowledge/Briefings/{YYYY-MM-DD}-evening.md`:

```
# Evening Summary — {Day, Month Date, Year}

## What Happened Today
- {Meeting with X — key decisions, action items}
- {Emails of note — replies received, threads resolved}
- {Knowledge graph updates — new contacts, projects}

## Still Outstanding
- {Priority items from morning not yet addressed}
- {New urgent items that came in today}

## Tomorrow Preview
- {First meeting: time, attendees}
- {Deadlines this week}
- {Items to prepare}
```

## 4. Report

```
Decision: {morning/evening} briefing — {key insight about today}
Action: Created knowledge/Briefings/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{morning|evening}.md
```
````

---

## Inter-Agent Communication

Agents communicate through three mechanisms, all file-based:

### 1. State Files (Agent → Agent)

Each scheduled agent writes a structured markdown file to the cache state
directory after every wake. Other agents read these files for cross-domain
awareness.

```
~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/
├── apple_mail_last_sync        # existing — sync timestamp
├── apple_calendar_last_sync    # existing — implicit from sync
├── graph_processed             # existing — processed files TSV
├── postman_triage.md           # NEW — postman's last triage
├── concierge_outlook.md        # NEW — concierge's last outlook
└── librarian_digest.md         # NEW — librarian's last digest
```

State files are overwritten on each wake (not appended). They represent the
latest snapshot, not a history. The scheduler's `state.json` tracks the history
(wake count, last action, last decision).

### 2. Knowledge Base (Agent → User → Agent)

The knowledge graph in `knowledge/` is the primary shared data store. Agents
write notes, briefings, and drafts. The user reads them. Other agents read them
for context.

```
knowledge/
├── People/          # librarian writes, all agents read
├── Organizations/   # librarian writes, all agents read
├── Projects/        # librarian writes, all agents read
├── Topics/          # librarian writes, all agents read
└── Briefings/       # chief of staff writes, user reads
    ├── 2026-02-23-morning.md
    └── 2026-02-23-evening.md

drafts/              # postman writes, user reads
├── {id}_draft.md
├── drafted
└── ignored
```

### 3. Cache Directory (Agent → Agent)

Synced raw data lives in `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/`. The postman syncs email
there; the librarian reads it for entity extraction. The concierge syncs events
there; the chief of staff reads them for daily schedules.

```
~/.cache/fit/basecamp/
├── apple_mail/       # postman writes, librarian reads
├── apple_calendar/   # concierge writes, chief-of-staff/librarian reads
└── state/            # all agents read/write their own state files
```

### No Explicit Messaging

There is no message queue, no pub/sub, no inter-process communication between
agents. The filesystem is the message bus. This is deliberate:

- **Observable:** Every piece of inter-agent state is a readable file
- **Debuggable:** `cat ~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/postman_triage.md`
- **Resilient:** If one agent fails, others continue with stale-but-valid state
- **Simple:** No coordination infrastructure to build or maintain

## Agent Execution Model

### Sequential, Priority-Ordered

When multiple agents are due in the same wake cycle, the scheduler runs them
sequentially in config order. Config order determines priority:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "postman": { ... },        // runs first — syncs mail for others
    "concierge": { ... },      // runs second — syncs calendar for others
    "librarian": { ... },      // runs third — processes synced data
    "chief-of-staff": { ... }  // runs last — reads all state files
  }
}
```

This ordering ensures:

1. Data sources are synced before processing (postman/concierge before
   librarian)
2. State files are fresh before synthesis (all agents before chief of staff)
3. No filesystem conflicts (one agent writes at a time)

### Cadence Interaction

With the default schedules, a typical hour looks like:

```
:00  postman → concierge → librarian
:05  postman
:10  postman → concierge
:15  postman → librarian
:20  postman → concierge
:25  postman
:30  postman → concierge → librarian
:35  postman
:40  postman → concierge
:45  postman → librarian
:50  postman → concierge
:55  postman
```

Chief of staff runs at 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM only, after all other due agents.

The scheduler processes agents in config order for each 60-second poll. If
postman is due at :05 and concierge is not, only postman runs. If both are due
at :10, postman runs first, then concierge. The existing `shouldWake()` logic
handles this — it checks each agent independently against its schedule and last
wake time.

## Scheduler Architecture

The scheduler changes from the existing plan apply directly. The infrastructure
supports multiple agents the same way it supported multiple tasks. Below is a
summary; the mechanics are the same as the previous plan with `tasks` → `agents`
vocabulary throughout.

### Config

`~/.fit/basecamp/scheduler.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "postman": {
      "kb": "~/Documents/Personal",
      "schedule": { "type": "interval", "minutes": 5 },
      "enabled": true
    },
    "concierge": {
      "kb": "~/Documents/Personal",
      "schedule": { "type": "interval", "minutes": 10 },
      "enabled": true
    },
    "librarian": {
      "kb": "~/Documents/Personal",
      "schedule": { "type": "interval", "minutes": 15 },
      "enabled": true
    },
    "chief-of-staff": {
      "kb": "~/Documents/Personal",
      "schedule": { "type": "cron", "expression": "0 7,18 * * *" },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

The config maps agent names to KB paths and schedules. Everything else —
behavior, skills, model, permissions — is defined in the agent's `.md` file
inside the KB's `.claude/agents/` directory.

### State Model

`~/.fit/basecamp/state.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "postman": {
      "status": "idle",
      "lastWokeAt": "2026-02-23T10:05:32.789Z",
      "lastAction": "draft-emails for thread 456",
      "lastDecision": "3 urgent emails, drafted reply to contract deadline thread",
      "wakeCount": 42,
      "startedAt": null,
      "lastError": null
    },
    "concierge": {
      "status": "idle",
      "lastWokeAt": "2026-02-23T10:00:15.123Z",
      "lastAction": "meeting-prep for 2pm with Sarah Chen",
      "lastDecision": "Meeting in 2h, no briefing exists for Sarah Chen",
      "wakeCount": 18,
      "startedAt": null,
      "lastError": null
    },
    "librarian": {
      "status": "idle",
      "lastWokeAt": "2026-02-23T09:45:08.456Z",
      "lastAction": "extract-entities on 7 files",
      "lastDecision": "7 unprocessed synced files, graph has 142 entities",
      "wakeCount": 6,
      "startedAt": null,
      "lastError": null
    },
    "chief-of-staff": {
      "status": "idle",
      "lastWokeAt": "2026-02-23T07:00:02.100Z",
      "lastAction": "Created knowledge/Briefings/2026-02-23-morning.md",
      "lastDecision": "Morning briefing — 4 meetings today, 3 urgent emails",
      "wakeCount": 2,
      "startedAt": null,
      "lastError": null
    }
  }
}
```

Status values: `"idle"`, `"active"`, `"failed"`, `"never-woken"`.

The scheduler parses `Decision:` and `Action:` lines from agent stdout to
populate `lastDecision` and `lastAction`. Falls back to the first 200 characters
of output if markers are absent.

### Code Changes (`src/basecamp.js`)

The same mechanical replacements as the previous plan:

| Current                                | New                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `loadConfig()` returns `{ tasks: {} }` | `loadConfig()` returns `{ agents: {} }` |
| `loadState()` checks `raw.tasks`       | `loadState()` checks `raw.agents`       |
| `runTask(name, task, config, state)`   | `wakeAgent(name, agent, config, state)` |
| `runDueTasks()`                        | `wakeDueAgents()`                       |
| `shouldRun(task, taskState, now)`      | `shouldWake(agent, agentState, now)`    |
| `computeNextRunAt()`                   | `computeNextWakeAt()`                   |

The execution function changes from constructing a prompt with a skill name to
invoking a named agent:

```javascript
// Current
const prompt = task.skill
  ? `Use the skill "${task.skill}" — ${task.prompt}`
  : task.prompt;
const spawnArgs = ["--print"];
if (task.agent) spawnArgs.push("--agent", task.agent);
spawnArgs.push("-p", prompt);

// New
const spawnArgs = ["--agent", agentName, "--print", "-p", "Observe and act."];
```

Output parsing for state tracking:

```javascript
const lines = stdout.split("\n");
const decisionLine = lines.find((l) => l.startsWith("Decision:"));
const actionLine = lines.find((l) => l.startsWith("Action:"));

Object.assign(agentState, {
  status: "idle",
  startedAt: null,
  lastWokeAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  lastDecision: decisionLine ? decisionLine.slice(10).trim() : stdout.slice(0, 200),
  lastAction: actionLine ? actionLine.slice(8).trim() : null,
  lastError: null,
  wakeCount: (agentState.wakeCount || 0) + 1,
});
```

### IPC Protocol

Status response:

```json
{
  "type": "status",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "agents": {
    "postman": {
      "enabled": true,
      "status": "idle",
      "lastWokeAt": "2026-02-23T10:05:32.789Z",
      "nextWakeAt": "2026-02-23T10:10:32.789Z",

    }
  }
}
```

New fields:

- **`kbPath`** — absolute path to the agent's knowledge base (resolved from
  config `kb` with `~` expanded). The Swift UI uses this for the "Open KB…"
  footer item.
- **`briefingFile`** — absolute path to the agent's latest output file. The
  Swift UI uses this for the "View Briefing" submenu action. See
  [Briefing File Resolution](#briefing-file-resolution) for how the daemon
  resolves this per agent.

Wake request: `{ "type": "wake", "agent": "postman" }`

### Validate Command

Checks that each configured agent has a corresponding `.md` file:

```javascript
for (const [name, agent] of Object.entries(config.agents)) {
  const kbPath = expandPath(agent.kb);
  const agentFile = join(kbPath, ".claude", "agents", name + ".md");
  const found = existsSync(agentFile) ||
    existsSync(join(HOME, ".claude", "agents", name + ".md"));
  console.log(`  [${found ? "OK" : "FAIL"}]  ${name}: agent definition`);
}
```

### Briefing File Resolution

The daemon resolves each agent's `briefingFile` path when constructing the IPC
status response. Each agent writes its output to a known location — the daemon
maps agent names to their output files:

```javascript
const AGENT_STATE_FILES = {
  postman: "postman_triage.md",
  concierge: "concierge_outlook.md",
  librarian: "librarian_digest.md",
};

function resolveBriefingFile(agentName, agentConfig) {
  const kbPath = expandPath(agentConfig.kb);

  // Most agents write to the cache state directory
  const stateFile = AGENT_STATE_FILES[agentName];
  if (stateFile) {
    const p = join(CACHE_DIR, "state", stateFile);
    return existsSync(p) ? p : null;
  }

  // Chief of staff writes to the KB briefings directory
  if (agentName === "chief-of-staff") {
    const dir = join(kbPath, "knowledge", "Briefings");
    if (!existsSync(dir)) return null;
    const files = readdirSync(dir)
      .filter((f) => f.endsWith(".md"))
      .sort()
      .reverse();
    return files.length > 0 ? join(dir, files[0]) : null;
  }

  return null;
}
```

The mapping is explicit rather than derived from a naming convention. This keeps
the descriptive file names (`postman_triage.md`, `concierge_outlook.md`,
`librarian_digest.md`) which aid debugging when browsing the filesystem
directly, while centralizing path knowledge in the daemon rather than
distributing it to clients.

### Updated: `template/CLAUDE.md`

Add a section describing the agent team:

```markdown
## Agents

This knowledge base is maintained by a team of agents, each defined in
`.claude/agents/`. They are woken on a schedule by the Basecamp scheduler.
Each wake, they observe KB state, decide the most valuable action, and execute.

| Agent | Domain | Schedule | Skills |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| **postman** | Email triage and drafts | Every 5 min | sync-apple-mail, draft-emails |
| **concierge** | Meeting prep and transcripts | Every 10 min | sync-apple-calendar, meeting-prep, process-hyprnote |
| **librarian** | Knowledge graph maintenance | Every 15 min | extract-entities, organize-files |
| **chief-of-staff** | Daily briefings and priorities | 7am, 6pm | _(reads all state)_ |

Agent state files are in `~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/`:
- `postman_triage.md` — latest email triage
- `concierge_outlook.md` — today's calendar outlook
- `librarian_digest.md` — knowledge graph status

Daily briefings are in `knowledge/Briefings/`.
```

### macOS App (Swift)

The Swift app shifts from a generic task-runner display to an agent-focused
status panel. Each agent is a first-class entity with its own decision context,
briefing file, and wake control. The UI's purpose changes from "show me what
tasks ran" to "show me what my agents are thinking."

#### Data Model (`DaemonConnection.swift`)

Replace `TaskStatus` and `StatusResponse` with agent-oriented models:

```swift
struct AgentStatus {
    let name: String
    let enabled: Bool
    let status: String          // "idle", "active", "failed", "never-woken"
    let lastWokeAt: Date?
    let nextWakeAt: Date?
    let lastAction: String?
    let lastDecision: String?
    let wakeCount: Int
    let lastError: String?
    let startedAt: Date?
    let kbPath: String?         // Absolute path to agent's knowledge base
    let briefingFile: String?   // Absolute path to agent's output file
}

struct StatusResponse {
    let uptime: Int
    let agents: [AgentStatus]   // Sorted by config order (not alphabetical)
}
```

IPC vocabulary changes:

| Current                                 | New                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `struct TaskStatus`                     | `struct AgentStatus`                      |
| `StatusResponse.tasks`                  | `StatusResponse.agents`                   |
| `requestRun(task:)`                     | `requestWake(agent:)`                     |
| Send `{ "type": "run", "task": "..." }` | Send `{ "type": "wake", "agent": "..." }` |
| Parse `json["tasks"]`                   | Parse `json["agents"]`                    |

Parsing reads `lastAction`, `lastDecision`, `kbPath`, and `briefingFile` as
optional strings. The `status` field uses agent vocabulary (`idle`, `active`,
`failed`, `never-woken`) instead of task vocabulary (`finished`, `running`,
`failed`, `never-run`).

#### Status Menu Layout (`StatusMenu.swift`)

The menu shows each agent's name, status, and last decision — giving the user
immediate visibility into what each agent observed and why it acted.

```
Basecamp          uptime 2h 15m
─────────────────────────────────
✓  Postman                  5m ago      ▶
   3 urgent, drafted reply to contract deadline
✓  Concierge              12m ago      ▶
   Meeting in 2h, prep needed for Sarah Chen
✓  Librarian               15m ago      ▶
   Extracted 7 files, graph at 142 entities
✓  Chief of Staff        7:00 AM      ▶
   4 meetings today, 3 urgent emails
─────────────────────────────────
📂 Open KB…
📂 Open Logs…
Quit Basecamp     (q)
```

Each agent occupies two menu items:

1. **Title item** — status icon + agent name + relative time. Has a submenu
   (indicated by ▶). This is a standard `NSMenuItem` with an attributed title
   for the colored status icon.
2. **Decision item** — `lastDecision` text, indented, smaller font,
   `.secondaryLabelColor`. This is a separate disabled `NSMenuItem` below the
   title. Truncated to 60 characters with ellipsis. Omitted entirely if
   `lastDecision` is nil (agent never woken).

This two-item pattern gives users the key insight at a glance: what did each
agent decide, and when? No submenu needed to understand current state.

#### Agent Submenu

Each enabled agent's title item has a submenu with actions:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ View Briefing                │  ← opens briefingFile in default app
│ Wake Now                     │  ← sends wake IPC message
│──────────────────────────────│
│ Error: connection timeout... │  ← if lastError (disabled, truncated)
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

- **View Briefing** — calls `NSWorkspace.shared.open(URL(fileURLWithPath:))` on
  `agentStatus.briefingFile`. Opens the agent's latest output file in the user's
  default markdown editor. Disabled (grayed out) if `briefingFile` is nil (file
  doesn't exist yet or agent never woken).
- **Wake Now** — sends `{ "type": "wake", "agent": "<name>" }` over IPC, then
  requests status after 1 second. Replaces the current "Run Now" action.
- **Error text** — last 80 characters of `lastError`, shown as a disabled item
  after a separator. Omitted if no error.

#### Footer Items

Replace the current single footer with agent-relevant actions:

| Item          | Action                                        | Source                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 📂 Open KB…   | `NSWorkspace.shared.open()` on KB directory   | First agent's `kbPath` from IPC     |
| 📂 Open Logs… | `NSWorkspace.shared.open()` on logs directory | `~/.fit/basecamp/logs/` (unchanged) |
| Quit Basecamp | `NSApp.terminate(nil)`                        | Unchanged                           |

"Open KB…" opens the knowledge base directory in Finder. The KB path is taken
from the first enabled agent's `kbPath` field in the status response. In
practice all agents share the same KB, so any agent's path works.

#### Status Icons and Colors

Updated vocabulary — status values change from task to agent semantics:

| Status        | Icon | Color          | Was         |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `idle`        | ✓    | `.systemGreen` | `finished`  |
| `active`      | ●    | `.systemBlue`  | `running`   |
| `failed`      | ✗    | `.systemRed`   | `failed`    |
| `never-woken` | ○    | `.systemGray`  | `never-run` |
| disabled      | —    | `.systemGray`  | disabled    |

#### Relative Time

Same logic as current, reading `lastWokeAt` instead of `lastRunAt`:

- `active` → "running"
- < 60s → "just now"
- < 1h → "Xm ago"
- < 24h → "Xh ago"
- ≥ 24h → "Xd ago"
- Never woken → "never"

#### Menu Tag Enum

```swift
private enum MenuTag: Int {
    case header = 100
    case connectionStatus = 101
    case agentBase = 1000           // agentBase + i*2 for title items
    case agentDecisionBase = 2000   // agentDecisionBase + i for decision items
}
```

Title items use `agentBase + i*2` and decision items use
`agentDecisionBase + i`. This allows in-place updates without rebuilding the
menu on every status poll.

#### In-Place Update Strategy

Same pattern as current — check if structural change occurred (connection state,
agent count), rebuild menu if so. Otherwise update in-place:

1. Header uptime text
2. Agent title items (icon, name, relative time via attributed title)
3. Agent decision items (lastDecision text)
4. Submenu error text (add/remove as needed)

The decision items require an additional check: if an agent transitions from
never-woken to idle (first wake), the decision item must be inserted. This
counts as a structural change and triggers a full rebuild.

#### Polling Strategy

Unchanged from current:

- Menu **open** → poll every 5 seconds
- Menu **closed** → poll every 30 seconds
- `NSMenuDelegate` tracks `menuWillOpen` / `menuDidClose`

## Design Tradeoffs

### Why four agents, not one?

The single-agent design (previous plan's `knowledge-curator`) works but has
three problems that grow with capability:

1. **Monolithic decision tree.** One agent choosing between mail sync, calendar
   sync, entity extraction, meeting prep, email drafting, file organization, and
   daily briefings creates a priority chain that's hard to reason about and
   tune. Adding a new capability means rethinking the entire priority order.

2. **Single cadence.** Email triage should happen every 5 minutes. Entity
   extraction can wait 15 minutes. Daily briefings happen twice a day. A single
   agent on a 5-minute timer wastes tokens on capabilities that don't need that
   frequency. A single agent on a 15-minute timer misses urgent emails.

3. **Context bloat.** Preloading all skills into one agent's context is
   expensive. The postman needs sync-apple-mail and draft-emails (2 skills).
   Loading all 7+ skills into every invocation wastes context on skills the
   agent won't use.

Four agents solve all three: each has a short, clear decision tree; each runs at
its natural cadence; each loads only its relevant skills.

### Why not more agents?

A dedicated sync agent (just mail + calendar sync) was considered but rejected.
Sync is a prerequisite for triage/prep, and bundling them in the same agent
avoids a wasted wake cycle (sync runs, then next cycle the triage agent reads
the results). The postman syncs and triages in the same wake — lower latency.

A dedicated "follow-up tracker" agent was considered but rejected. Follow-up
tracking is part of the postman's triage (awaiting response) and chief-of-staff
synthesis (open commitments). Creating a separate agent would fragment email
awareness.

### Why cron for briefing, not interval?

Briefings are time-anchored — a morning briefing at 10 AM is less useful than
one at 7 AM. Cron schedules (`0 7,18 * * *`) ensure briefings arrive at the
right time. Interval schedules would drift and produce briefings at random
hours.

### Why no inter-agent messaging?

Direct messaging (queues, signals, events) adds infrastructure complexity with
marginal benefit. The filesystem provides eventual consistency — the postman
writes `postman_triage.md`, and the chief of staff reads it on its next wake.
The delay is at most one briefing cycle (12 hours), which is acceptable because
briefings are daily summaries, not real-time alerts.

If real-time coordination is needed in the future (e.g., "postman detects urgent
email → immediately wake chief of staff"), the scheduler can support
`{ "type": "signal", "from": "postman", "to": "chief-of-staff" }` IPC messages.
But this is premature today.

### Why the chief of staff has no skills

The chief of staff reads files and writes markdown. It doesn't sync data, draft
emails, or extract entities — those are other agents' jobs. Giving it skills
would blur domain boundaries and create the same monolithic design we're
avoiding.

The chief of staff's value is synthesis, not action. It reads the outputs of all
other agents and produces a human-readable summary. This is a fundamentally
different kind of work.

### Why descriptive file names, not standardized `{agent}.md`?

The state files use descriptive names — `postman_triage.md`,
`concierge_outlook.md`, `librarian_digest.md` — rather than a uniform
`{agent_name}.md` convention. This was considered and rejected for three
reasons:

1. **Debuggability.** `ls ~/.cache/fit/basecamp/state/` immediately tells you
   what each file contains. With `postman.md` you'd have to open the file to
   know it's a triage report. The plan values the filesystem as an observable
   message bus — descriptive names support that.

2. **The chief of staff breaks the pattern.** The chief of staff writes to
   `knowledge/Briefings/{date}-{type}.md`, not to the cache state directory. No
   single naming convention covers all agents, so a convention-based approach
   still requires special-casing.

3. **The daemon resolves paths, not the UI.** The `briefingFile` field in the
   IPC status response gives the Swift UI the exact path to open. The UI never
   constructs paths from agent names — it receives them. This means file names
   can change without UI changes, and new agents can write to arbitrary
   locations without protocol changes.

The cost is a small mapping table in the daemon (`AGENT_STATE_FILES`). This is
acceptable because agent definitions change infrequently and the mapping is
co-located with the agent execution logic.

### Cost profile

| Configuration            | Invocations/hour | Notes                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current (3 tasks)        | 36               | 3 tasks × 12 wakes/hour                                        |
| Single agent (prev plan) | 12               | 1 agent × 12 wakes/hour                                        |
| Multi-agent              | ~22              | postman(12) + concierge(6) + librarian(4) + chief-of-staff(~0) |

Multi-agent uses fewer invocations than the current system. Each invocation is
more efficient because agents load only their relevant skills. The net token
cost is comparable to the single-agent design because smaller contexts offset
higher invocation counts.

## File Change Summary

| `package.json`                     | version bump                                                         |

### Deleted

None. Skills stay. Config is replaced in-place.

## Why This Is a Clean Break

1. **No coexistence.** Config has `agents`, not `tasks`. Old configs won't load.
2. **No compatibility shims.** No `if (config.tasks) migrateTasks()`.
3. **No wrapper functions.** `wakeAgent()` replaces `runTask()`.
4. **All call sites updated.** CLI, daemon, IPC, status, validate.
5. **Delete immediately.** `task.prompt`, `task.skill`, `runTask()` are gone.

## Implementation Order

1. Create `template/.claude/agents/` with all four agent `.md` files
2. Create `template/knowledge/Briefings/.gitkeep`
3. Replace `config/scheduler.json` (three tasks → four agents)
4. Rewrite `src/basecamp.js` (tasks → agents throughout)
5. Update `template/CLAUDE.md` (add agent team section)
6. Update Swift files: a. `DaemonConnection.swift` — `AgentStatus` model,
   `briefingFile`/`kbPath` parsing, `requestWake()` b. `StatusMenu.swift` —
   agent-focused layout with decision subtitles, View Briefing action, Open KB
   footer
7. Update `package.json` version
8. Run `npm run check` and fix issues
