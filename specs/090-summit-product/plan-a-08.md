# Plan A — Part 08: Documentation, release readiness, STATUS advancement

## Goal

Close out spec 090 by bringing the documentation and repository metadata in line
with the shipped implementation:

1. Rewrite the existing Summit website pages against real behaviour.
2. Add Summit to CONTRIBUTING.md and the operations reference where required.
3. Verify the CLAUDE.md Summit reference (already written) still matches.
4. Confirm `package.json` workspaces picks up Summit automatically.
5. Advance `specs/STATUS` 090 to `done`.

This part is documentation-only. Route it to the `technical-writer` agent — code
changes are already merged by the end of Part 07.

## Inputs

- All preceding parts must be merged and verified green before this part runs.
- Existing pages under `website/summit/index.md` and
  `website/docs/internals/summit/index.md` (placeholder content already exists —
  verified present).
- `CLAUDE.md` Summit entry (lines 59–64 in the current file).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — check for product lists that need updating.
- `website/docs/internals/operations/` — check for per-product references that
  need Summit.

## Files Modified

### `website/summit/index.md`

Currently a placeholder. Rewrite against the shipped CLI:

- **Hero** — keep existing "See team capability as a system" framing.
- **What you get** — bullet list synced to actual commands shipped: coverage,
  risks, what-if, growth, compare, trajectory, roster, validate. Mention that
  `--evidenced` and `--outcomes` are optional enhancements that require Map's
  activity layer.
- **Getting started** — exact commands an external user runs. Important: this
  page is **external-facing**, so it must use
  `npm install @forwardimpact/summit` and `npx fit-summit …`, never
  `bun`/`bunx`/`just`. Per CLAUDE.md rule (line 120).
- **Example walkthrough** — pick one command (coverage is the most illustrative)
  and show a real output snippet. Use the starter discipline / track data so the
  example is reproducible against a fresh install.
- **Three views** section — shorten to match the actual commands; the current
  placeholder has some speculative content.

### `website/docs/internals/summit/index.md`

Internal-facing architecture deep-dive. Rewrite to match what Part 02–07
actually shipped:

- **Overview** — keep.
- **Architecture diagram** — add a block showing the three optional layers (core
  deterministic → evidence decorator → outcomes decorator).
- **Skill Matrix Aggregation** — update with the `TeamCoverage` shape from
  plan-a.md "Data Model".
- **Structural Risk Detection** — document the thresholds chosen in Part 03
  (`CONCENTRATION_THRESHOLD = 3`, severity tiers for SPOFs) so future
  contributors know where the knobs are.
- **What-If Simulation** — explain the clone-then-aggregate approach and why
  deep cloning via `structuredClone` is safe.
- **Growth Logic Export** — document the `computeGrowthAlignment` public
  signature and the Landmark contract. Link to spec 080 as the downstream
  consumer.
- **Trajectory** — document the git-history approach and its limitations. Cite
  that Map historical snapshots are a future extension.
- **Evidence and Outcomes** — describe the decorator architecture and the
  lazy-import strategy for `@supabase/supabase-js`.
- Internal-facing, so `bun`/`bunx`/`just` commands are fine here.

### `CLAUDE.md`

Verify the Summit entry at lines 59–64 still matches the shipped product.
Specifically confirm:

- The one-line description ("Helps leadership answer _is this team supported to
  reach peak performance?_").
- Both page links:
  `[Overview](website/summit/index.md) · [Internals](website/docs/internals/summit/index.md)`.

If the shipped behaviour diverges from what's on lines 59–64, update the
CLAUDE.md entry accordingly. This is the canonical product index — it must
reflect reality.

### `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Check whether CONTRIBUTING references the product list by name anywhere (e.g.
"Supported products: Map, Pathway, Basecamp, Guide, Landmark"). If so, add
Summit to that list. If not, this section is a no-op.

### `website/docs/internals/operations/index.md` (and sub-pages)

Check whether the operations reference has per-product sections (service
management, data locations, common tasks). If Summit needs an entry — for
example, documenting the `data/summit/summit.yaml` location — add it. If
operations is purely service-oriented, Summit doesn't need a section since it
has no services.

### `website/docs/getting-started/leadership/index.md`

The CLAUDE.md mentions this page as the "Getting started (leadership)" entry.
Since Summit targets leaders, add a "Summit" subsection or call-out linking to
`website/summit/index.md`. Keep it short — the full content lives on the product
page.

### `specs/STATUS`

**Default:** staged advancement matching the spec lifecycle:

- When `gemba-plan` approves this plan and the spec — advance `draft → planned`
  in a separate commit (owned by whoever approves the plan, not Part 08).
- When Part 01 begins implementation — advance `planned → active`.
- When Part 08 lands on `main` — advance `active → done`.

Part 08 itself is responsible only for the final `active → done` transition. It
is conditional on all parts 01–07 being merged, tests green on `main`, and at
least one published version of `@forwardimpact/summit` existing on npm (or
queued for release via the next release-engineer run). If any of those are
incomplete, leave STATUS alone and flag in the wiki log.

The earlier `draft → planned` and `planned → active` transitions may appear in
other commits. Do not skip them — the lifecycle is an audit trail across the
full delivery, not a single commit marker.

## Files NOT Modified

- `package.json` root — `products/*` workspace wildcard already picks Summit up.
  No explicit list to update.
- `justfile` — Summit doesn't need a root recipe unless there's a compelling
  repeated task. Inspect first; only add a recipe if one of Parts 01–07
  references it.
- `scripts/check-package-layout.js` — Summit must conform without any allow-list
  changes. No modification.
- `scripts/check-exports-resolve.js` — same.

## Verification

1. **Link check.** All inbound links to `website/summit/index.md` and
   `website/docs/internals/summit/` from CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and
   elsewhere still resolve.
2. **Docs build.** Run whatever website build Pathway uses (likely
   `just build-website` or `bunx fit-pathway build` — check the operations
   reference). Confirm it produces the Summit pages without errors.
3. **External-user commands work.** A clean `npm install @forwardimpact/summit`
   followed by `npx fit-summit --help` works as the website instructs.
4. **CLAUDE.md grep.** `rg -n 'Summit' CLAUDE.md` returns the entry at lines
   59–64 and no stale references elsewhere.
5. **STATUS.** `specs/STATUS` 090 reads `done`.
6. **Agent memory updated.** Append a staff-engineer log entry for the week
   noting "090 done".

## Commit

Two logical commits are appropriate here because documentation and status
advancement are distinct concerns:

```
docs(summit): rewrite overview and internals pages against shipped commands
```

and

```
chore(specs): advance spec 090 to done
```

Land them sequentially on the documentation branch.

## Risks

- **Doc drift.** If Parts 01–07 diverged from plan-a in subtle ways (for
  example, a flag was renamed during implementation), the placeholder content on
  the existing website pages may carry the older name. Read the actual CLI help
  output before writing prose — do not trust the spec text verbatim.
- **External vs. internal command docs.** Easy to accidentally use `bunx` or
  `just` in a page that's supposed to be external-facing. Enforce with a final
  `rg -n '\bbunx?\b|\bjust\b' website/summit/index.md` check — should return
  zero matches.
- **STATUS lifecycle skipping.** The spec is currently `draft`, not `planned`.
  Advancing straight to `done` skips the `planned`/`active` phases. If the
  product manager wants the full lifecycle, split STATUS advancement across the
  parts: Part 01 entry moves 090 to `planned`, Part 02 moves to `active`, Part
  08 moves to `done`. Call this out in the wiki log and let the product manager
  choose.

## Notes for the implementer

- This is a `technical-writer` part — don't write new code. If a code fix
  surfaces while updating docs, file it as a follow-up spec rather than sneaking
  it into this commit.
- Both website pages are currently placeholders; the rewrite is substantial.
  Budget accordingly.
- Keep the internals page technical: readers are contributors, not end users.
  Details like "`structuredClone` is safe because…" are on-topic.
- The product page is aspirational — it sells the product. Focus on the
  questions Summit answers, not the API surface.
