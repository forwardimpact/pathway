# Citation Inventory — Spec 1060

Inventory of call sites carrying the old memory-protocol terminology
(`#action-routing` anchor, `Tier 1/2` headings, `Memory Tiers` heading, `80-line`
cap, `Cross-Cutting Priority Index`, `wiki-audit.sh`). Status column maps each
call site to the part that lands the update; rows tagged `historical exempt` are
research artifacts dated 2026-05-16 or pre-cutover weekly logs.

Built via `rg -n 'memory-protocol|MEMORY\.md|<!-- memo:inbox -->|80-line|Tier
1|Tier 2|Memory Tiers|Cross-Cutting Priority|Action Routing|wiki-audit\.sh|action-routing'
.claude/ CONTRIBUTING.md KATA.md` at the Part 02 commit.

After Part 05 lands, the only rows tagged `historical exempt` are the five
2026-05-16 research-corpus files. Every other call site is on the new
terminology, mechanically.
