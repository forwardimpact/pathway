# Plan 860-b — Measurement-system change protocol (design-b)

Spec: [spec.md](spec.md) · Design: [design-b.md](design-b.md)

## Rationale

Pairs with `design-b.md`. A sibling `plan-a.md` would pair with `design-a.md`.
The approver selects which design variant to implement; this plan becomes
live only if design-b is chosen.

## Approach

Land the protocol section in `coordination-protocol.md`. Link from `KATA.md` § Metrics. Add `approvals_recorded_per_run` to `kata-release-merge` (one new row in `references/metrics.md`, one new sub-step 8.5 in `SKILL.md`). Add the `Redefinition:` slot to the Headlines bullet template in `storyboard-template.md`. The wiki-side updates (canonical enumeration, denominator increment, one observed first-row CSV entry) ship through the separate wiki checkout in the implementation run.

Libraries used: none.

## Step 1 — `coordination-protocol.md` § Measurement-system changes

Add a new H2 section between `## Approval signal` (line 34) and
`## Decision questions` (line 62). **Modified:**
`.claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md`.

Section body, in order:

1. **Lead paragraph** (≤4 lines) — one sentence introducing the section.
2. **Eight repair-move table** with columns `Move | Definition | Falsifier-set kind | Existing precedent`:

   | Move | Definition (one sentence) | Falsifier-set kind | Existing precedent |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `producer-rehoming` | Reassign a metric's producing skill when the original is removed/split/renamed; record a continuity tag on the first row under the new producer. | "structural-zero rows present after rehoming run" | #788, RFC #804 |
   | `mode-restriction` | Narrow recording to one activation mode of a multi-mode skill so the series is unimodal. | "post-restriction series remains bimodal under XmR" | #772, PR #773 |
   | `historical-phasing` | Annotate a series with a Phase boundary; XmR analysis windows on Phase 1; no CSV backfill. | "Phase 1 cannot reach `predictable` after horizon" | #809, PR #811 |
   | `sidecar-pre-flight` | Record a candidate metric to a sibling CSV while the canonical metric continues; no denominator change until ratification. | "sidecar diverges from canonical at horizon" | #787 |
   | `stock-vs-flow-recast` | Replace a flow-rate metric with a stock metric on the same axis when burst architecture trips XmR by construction. | "stock series fires `xRule1` or `mrRule1` post-recast" | #768, #770 |
   | `event-driven-recast` | Replace per-day cadence with per-activation ("no row, no event"). | "per-activation series remains `insufficient_data` at horizon" | #810 |
   | `rule-semantics-rfc` | Challenge an XmR rule's blocking effect on `predictable` via Discussion RFC; quorum required. | "RFC quorum not reached by horizon" | #814 |
   | `habit-to-policy` | Promote an undocumented defensive habit into a `SKILL.md` check after a defect surfaces. | "post-promotion defect of the same shape recurs" | #817, PR #655 |

   One sentence below the table: "The list is closed; extensions land via the spec/design/plan/implement chain."

3. **Redefinition shape** — a fenced YAML code block exactly matching design-b § Redefinition shape (file artifact). One sentence below states `verdict_horizon ≤ cohort_readout` and the `denominator_effect` enum semantics.
4. **No-silent-redefinition rule** — blockquote verbatim from design-b § No-silent-redefinition rule (the blockquote already contains the "KATA.md § Metrics links to it; no other file restates it." sentence — do not duplicate it).
5. **Worked example** (spec Success #2) — heading `### Worked example — SE Exp 33 (#787) sidecar pre-flight`. Inline YAML front-matter populated for the SE Exp 33 case (`move: sidecar-pre-flight`, `affected_metrics: [{skill: kata-trace, metric: findings_count}]`, falsifier `sidecar diverges from canonical at horizon`, `verdict_horizon: 2026-05-19`, `cohort_readout: 2026-05-26`, `denominator_effect: sidecar`, `links.experiment_issue: "#787"`, `links.obstacle_issue: "#788"`). The example is **inline only**; no on-disk founding redefinition file is created (design § Migration boundary grandfathers the spec 860 implementation PR).
6. **Detection** — heading `### Detection`. The fenced `sh` block from design-b verbatim. One sentence above states the rule ("any commit touching a canonical-11 metric edge must, in the same commit, add or modify a `wiki/redefinitions/*.md` file"); one sentence below names the edges (`wiki/storyboard-*.md`, `.claude/skills/*/references/metrics.md`, `coordination-protocol.md` § Measurement-system changes) and acknowledges per design § Detection that cross-repo enforcement (between this monorepo and the wiki repo) is the follow-on CI workstream.

Verify: `rg '^## Measurement-system changes$' .claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md` returns one hit;
`rg -c '^\| \`(producer-rehoming|mode-restriction|historical-phasing|sidecar-pre-flight|stock-vs-flow-recast|event-driven-recast|rule-semantics-rfc|habit-to-policy)\`' .claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md` returns 8 (note: brittle on table-cell whitespace — re-run after `bun run format:fix`);
`rg '^### Worked example' .claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md` returns one hit;
`rg '^### Detection' .claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md` returns one hit.

## Step 2 — `KATA.md` § Metrics linking paragraph

One edit to § Metrics (currently lines 257–274). **Modified:** `KATA.md`.

Insert one paragraph before the blank line that separates § Metrics from § Authentication (after line 274):

```markdown
Changes to the canonical-11 set — additions, removals, conditional or
unconditional redefinitions — follow the protocol in
[`coordination-protocol.md` § Measurement-system changes](.claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md#measurement-system-changes):
each change ships in the same PR as a `wiki/redefinitions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md`
file naming the repair move, the affected metric(s), the falsifier set, the
verdict horizon, and the cohort read-out date. The no-silent-redefinition rule
lives there; this section does not restate it.
```

Verify: `rg -n 'Measurement-system changes' KATA.md` returns one match in § Metrics; `git diff KATA.md` shows exactly one inserted paragraph and no other hunks. Line 261 is unchanged.

## Step 3 — `kata-release-merge` `references/metrics.md` new row

Add the new metric alongside `prs_merged`. **Modified:**
`.claude/skills/kata-release-merge/references/metrics.md`.

Replace the single-row table with two rows:

```markdown
| Metric                       | Unit  | Description                                                                                                  | Data source                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| prs_merged                   | count | PRs merged this run                                                                                          | Run actions                                  |
| approvals_recorded_per_run   | count | `<phase>:approved` label-add events + APPROVED review events observed in `[prev_run_start, current_run_start)` | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<n>/timeline` + `.../pulls/<n>/reviews`         |
```

Append below the existing "Backlog … is queried, not recorded." line:

```markdown
`prev_run_start` is the `startedAt` of the previous completed `agent-team`
workflow run, fetched with `gh run list --workflow=agent-team.yml`. Cohort:
all open phase PRs surveyed in SKILL.md Step 1 plus any phase PR merged
within the window (Step 8). `plan:implemented` is a state label, excluded.
See [`coordination-protocol.md` § Measurement-system changes](../../../agents/references/coordination-protocol.md#measurement-system-changes).
```

Verify: `rg -n 'approvals_recorded_per_run' .claude/skills/kata-release-merge/references/metrics.md` returns ≥1 hit; the table renders as two data rows under one header.

## Step 4 — `kata-release-merge` SKILL.md recording instructions

Two edits to wire the metric. **Modified:**
`.claude/skills/kata-release-merge/SKILL.md`.

Code blocks below use four-tick outer fences so inner triple-backticks land verbatim in `SKILL.md`. The implementer pastes the body between the outer four-ticks; the inner three-tick fences are part of the body. GNU `date -d` is used; the agent runs on Linux GitHub-hosted runners.

**Edit 4a — append to the end of the `### Step 0: Read Memory` body:**

````markdown
Capture this run's start timestamp once at the top of the run:
`current_run_start=$(date -u +%FT%TZ)`. For the approval-throughput metric
(Step 8.5), also derive the previous run's start:

```sh
prev_run_start=$(gh run list --workflow=agent-team.yml --status=completed \
  --limit 2 --json startedAt --jq '.[1].startedAt // empty')
# First-ever recording falls back to current_run_start - 8h
# (median schedule gap of the 03:00/12:00/20:00 UTC cadence).
[ -z "$prev_run_start" ] && prev_run_start=$(date -u -d "$current_run_start - 8 hours" +%FT%TZ)
```

The window for approval-throughput counting is `[prev_run_start, current_run_start)`.
````

**Edit 4b — insert a new `### Step 8.5` between Step 8 (line 165) and Step 9 (line 166).** Step 9's existing body and `## Memory: what to record` are unchanged; Memory's existing "Append one row per run to `wiki/metrics/{skill}/` per `references/metrics.md`" bullet produces two rows per run once Step 3 lands the new metric definition.

Insert:

````markdown
### Step 8.5: Collect approval-throughput count

Cohort: every PR seen in Step 1 (open phase PRs) plus every phase PR
merged this run (Step 8) — covers every phase PR with window-relevant
activity. For each cohort PR, fetch label-add events:

```sh
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<number>/timeline --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.event=="labeled" and (.label.name|test("^(spec|design|plan):approved$"))) | {ts: .created_at, kind: "label", label: .label.name}'
```

And APPROVED reviews:

```sh
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/reviews --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.state=="APPROVED") | {ts: .submitted_at, kind: "review"}'
```

Filter events to `ts ∈ [prev_run_start, current_run_start)` (half-open;
matches design-b § Approval-throughput metric). Sum the filtered events
to `approvals_recorded_per_run` — no per-event de-dup; the design
specifies a raw count. The Memory section appends one row per metric to
`wiki/metrics/kata-release-merge/{YYYY}.csv`; the row shape mirrors the
existing `prs_merged` rows with `metric=approvals_recorded_per_run`,
`unit=count`, and `note="window=[<prev>,<curr>)"`. Zero is recorded as `0`.

If any per-PR call fails (rate limit, scope), skip that PR, append
`;api_errors=N` to the row's `note` field, and proceed. A blanket-failure
case (every call errored) records `0` with a non-empty `api_errors=` so
the next storyboard meeting can see producer health.
````

(The REST endpoints differ from design-b § Approval-throughput metric's claim of an "existing `gh pr view --json labels,timelineItems`" surface — `gh pr view --json` does not accept `timelineItems`. The plan uses the REST timeline + reviews endpoints, the working surface; this is Risk 2.)

Verify: `rg -n 'approvals_recorded_per_run|prev_run_start|current_run_start' .claude/skills/kata-release-merge/SKILL.md` returns ≥4 hits; `### Step 8.5: Collect approval-throughput count` exists between `### Step 8: Merge` and `### Step 9: Produce`; the existing Step 9 body and Memory section are unchanged.

## Step 5 — `storyboard-template.md` Redefinition link slot

Add the `Redefinition:` field to the Headlines bullet template only. The
canonical-12 enumeration lives in `wiki/storyboard-*.md` per design
§ Components, not in the main-repo template. **Modified:**
`.claude/skills/kata-session/references/storyboard-template.md`.

Replace line 33 (currently
`- \`{agent}\` / \`{metric}\` — {value} {trend/badge} — {one-line reason}`) with:

```markdown
- `{agent}` / `{metric}` — {value} {trend/badge} — {one-line reason} — Redefinition: {`wiki/redefinitions/...md` or `—`}
```

Verify: `rg -n 'Redefinition:' .claude/skills/kata-session/references/storyboard-template.md` returns one hit; `git diff` shows one changed line and no inserts elsewhere.

## Step 6 — `team-storyboard.md` worked-example refresh

The Q3-obstacle-routing worked example (lines 102–105) is historical (dated 2026-05-02). The historical `canonical-11` reference is unchanged. **Modified:** `.claude/skills/kata-session/references/team-storyboard.md`.

Append one sentence and a one-line slot-data demonstration to the existing worked example: "Each headline bullet for the four metrics carries the new `Redefinition:` slot per [`coordination-protocol.md` § Measurement-system changes](../../../agents/references/coordination-protocol.md#measurement-system-changes); for this date the value is `—` on all four. Example: `- kata-release-merge / prs_actioned — … — Redefinition: —`."

Verify: `rg -n 'Redefinition: —' .claude/skills/kata-session/references/team-storyboard.md` returns one hit on the worked example; the historical "canonical-11" reference at line 103 is unchanged.

## Step 7 — Wiki: `storyboard-2026-M05.md` enumeration update + one observed CSV row

Wiki-side changes committed through the separate `wiki/` checkout during
the implementation run; pushed via the Stop hook (`just wiki-push`).
**Modified:** `wiki/storyboard-2026-M05.md`, `wiki/metrics/kata-release-merge/2026.csv`.

The implementor reads `wiki/storyboard-2026-M05.md` first; let `N` be the
current canonical-set cardinality (the count of `{producer}/{metric}` items
named in the May storyboard's "N canonical metrics" prose). Edits:

1. **Replace inline "N canonical metrics" prose** under § Target Condition
   with a bulleted enumeration: one bullet per metric mapping
   `{producer skill} / {metric name}`. The new metric joins as
   `kata-release-merge / approvals_recorded_per_run`. The implementor
   reads each producer's `.claude/skills/kata-*/references/metrics.md` to
   pull the exact metric name. Bullet count = `N + 1`.
2. **Increment the denominator** anywhere the May storyboard literally
   writes `≥M of N` → `≥M of (N+1)`. Pre-edit enumeration:
   `rg -n '≥[0-9]+ of [0-9]+' wiki/storyboard-2026-M05.md`. The post-edit
   `rg` returns the same number of lines, each with the incremented
   denominator.
3. **Add a `Redefinition:` slot to every existing Headlines bullet** with
   value `—` (no canonical change was filed for any current headline).
4. **Append one observed first row** to
   `wiki/metrics/kata-release-merge/2026.csv` by invoking the new Step
   8.5 logic once locally during the implementation run against the
   actual open phase-PR set at that moment. The implementor derives
   `prev_run_start` and `current_run_start` exactly as SKILL.md Step 0
   prescribes (the `gh run list --workflow=agent-team.yml` lookup
   returns the prior scheduled run's `startedAt` even though
   `kata-release-merge` has not yet recorded the new metric). Date is
   the run's date; value is whatever the live survey returns (zero is
   valid); the `note` carries the actual `window=[<prev>,<curr>)`. The
   row is *measured*, satisfying spec Success #4(c).

Verify (in the wiki checkout):
- Pre-edit and post-edit counts of `≥[0-9]+ of [0-9]+` matches in
  `wiki/storyboard-2026-M05.md` are equal; every post-edit match has the
  incremented denominator.
- `rg -c 'approvals_recorded_per_run' wiki/storyboard-2026-M05.md` returns ≥1.
- `rg -c '^- \`' wiki/storyboard-2026-M05.md` in the new enumeration block returns `N + 1`.
- Every Headlines bullet contains the substring `Redefinition:`.
- `rg '^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2},approvals_recorded_per_run,' wiki/metrics/kata-release-merge/2026.csv` returns ≥1 row whose `window=` field is non-empty.

## Step 8 — Quality gates

Run from repo root in order: `bun run format:fix`, `bun run check`, `bun run test`. The change set is documentation-only on the main-repo side; no codegen or build steps are involved.

Verify locally before push: `bun run check` exits 0. PR title carries the spec id (e.g., `feat(kata): measurement-system change protocol (#860)`).

## Risks

1. **Design-b internal contradiction on metric cardinality.** Design-b § Components admits `approvals_recorded_per_run` as "additional rows" in `kata-release-merge`'s existing CSV (cardinality 2), while decision #4 commits to "preserving KATA.md 'count of units of work'" and decision #1 states "no constitutional change." KATA.md line 261 ("each such skill records exactly one metric") is unchanged on landing under this plan, so the new row textually contradicts that line. The plan honors design-b § Components' literal component table (the more concrete of the two design surfaces); the implementation PR body must surface this contradiction so the approver can either accept it (the plan's path) or block on a follow-on governance spec that amends KATA.md line 261. The plan cannot resolve a design-internal contradiction unilaterally.
2. **Design-b API-surface claim is factually incorrect.** Design-b § Approval-throughput metric states "No new GitHub-API surface beyond the existing `gh pr view --json labels,timelineItems`," but `gh pr view --json` does not accept a `timelineItems` field (verified against `gh` 2.63.2 — available PR fields include `labels`, `latestReviews`, `reviews`, but not `timelineItems`). The plan uses `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<n>/timeline` (REST) plus `.../pulls/<n>/reviews` instead — the working surface that returns the events the metric needs. This is technically "new API surface" relative to the SKILL.md's current `gh api` calls (Step 2 contributor lookup) but no new auth or scope. Implementation PR body should note the design's surface claim was incorrect; reviewers may file a doc-correction redefinition (`move: rule-semantics-rfc` or similar) against design-b after merge.
3. **GitHub REST timeline endpoint shape stability.** The REST timeline (`gh api .../issues/<n>/timeline`) returns events with `event: "labeled"`, `label.name`, `created_at`. A breaking change in the GitHub REST API would silently emit `0`s. The producer-rehoming move (Step 1 table row 1) is the protocol response if `xRule3` fires on eight consecutive zeros.
4. **Wiki-vs-main-repo PR boundary on Success #6.** Design-b § Detection states cross-repo CI enforcement is the follow-on, out of scope. The detection grep works **within the wiki checkout**. For main-repo edges (`coordination-protocol.md`, `.claude/skills/*/references/metrics.md`), Success #6 holds only when those edges are accompanied by a wiki commit adding a redefinition file — a coupling the follow-on CI must verify across the two repos.
5. **GitHub timeline fan-out.** Step 8.5 calls `gh api .../timeline` once per cohort PR per run. With ~15 open phase PRs the call count is fine; past ~30 the run risks secondary rate limits during the 03:00/12:00/20:00 windows. A future optimisation short-circuits on PRs whose `updated_at` precedes `prev_run_start`. The blanket-failure branch records `0` with a non-empty `api_errors=` note so producer health is visible on the chart.
6. **`gh run list` window-source workflow-name binding.** Step 4a's `--workflow=agent-team.yml` is operational: if `kata-release-merge` is ever moved to a separate workflow file, this argument must move with it. Not visible from the SKILL.md body alone.

## Execution recommendation

Single staff-engineer executor, sequential. Steps 1–6 (main-repo edits) run in order: Step 2 cites Step 1's anchor; Step 4 cites Step 3's metric definition; Step 6 cites Step 5's bullet template format. Step 7 runs after the main-repo edits — the wiki edits cite anchors Step 1 and Step 2 establish, and Step 7.4's "one observed CSV row" runs the Step 8.5 logic that Step 4 lands. Step 8 closes. No parallelism; no decomposition into parts. Route entirely to the engineering agent — every edit is a code/doc change with no prose audience that warrants `technical-writer`.
