# Spec 640 — Refactor Test Suite for Speed and Maintenance

## Problem

The test suite has grown to 211 files / 45,456 lines / 3,089 test cases, and it
is slow to run and time-consuming to maintain. `libraries/libharness/` was
created to hold shared fixtures and mocks, but adoption has stalled: coding
agents consistently pick the local optimum and reinvent helpers inline rather
than extend the shared library.

### Evidence

Measured on branch `claude/refactor-test-suite-Fx4EQ` at 2026-04-23:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Test files | 211 |
| Total LOC in test files | 45,456 |
| Test cases | 3,089 |
| Test files importing `@forwardimpact/libharness` | **37 (17.5%)** |
| Test files with local `createMock*` / `mockStorage` / `createFake*` | 67 |
| Files using raw `assert.throws` / `assert.rejects` | 82 |
| Files using libharness `assertThrowsMessage` / `assertRejectsMessage` | **0** |
| Tests that call `createDataLoader().loadAllData()` (real YAML I/O) | 27 |
| Tests using `mkdtempSync` / real tmp dirs | 12 |
| Tests doing real `fs.readFile` / `readFileSync` | 20 |
| Tests spawning child processes / real servers | 6 |
| Test files > 300 LOC | 52 |
| Test files > 200 LOC | 107 |
| Full `bun run test` wall-clock | 16.3 s (serial, `--test-concurrency=0`) |

### Structural issues found

1. **Serial execution is hard-coded.** `package.json` runs `node --test
   --test-concurrency=0`, which forces one test file at a time.
2. **Products almost never use libharness.** 0 of 19 `products/map` tests,
   0 of 17 `products/landmark` tests, and 0 of 12 root `tests/model-*.test.js`
   files import it. They redefine framework fixtures (disciplines, levels,
   tracks, skills, behaviours) 10+ times.
3. **Existing libharness helpers are reimplemented.** `MockMetadata` is
   redefined four times in `libraries/libtelemetry/test/*` even though
   `libharness` already exports it. `createMockStorage`, `createMockLogger`,
   and `createMockFs` are duplicated across at least seven subsystems.
4. **Ad-hoc `make*` vs `createTest*` naming.** `libraries/libskill/test/`
   invented a parallel fixture layer (`makeDiscipline`, `makeLevel`,
   `makeSeniorLevel`, `makeSkills`, `makeBehaviours`, `makeCapabilities`,
   `makeDrivers`) that duplicates the pathway fixtures already in libharness.
5. **Coverage loops.** The 12 root `tests/model-*.test.js` files, the 16
   `libraries/libskill/test/*` files, and `services/pathway/test/integration.test.js`
   overlap on libskill matching/derivation behaviour.

## Goal

Halve both maintenance surface (duplicate fixture/mock definitions) and
wall-clock test time. Coverage reduction is allowed where redundant, but it
must not be the only fix — the primary levers are consolidation into
libharness and removing real I/O from unit tests.

## Scope

### A. Move into libharness

Concrete helpers to add, with call sites that will collapse once they exist.

#### A.1 Framework-data fixtures

Framework data (capabilities / skills / disciplines / tracks / drivers /
behaviours / levels) is inlined or re-defined in at least 20 places.

| Helper | Consumers (examples) |
| --- | --- |
| `createTestFramework(overrides?)` → returns `{ capabilities, skills, disciplines, tracks, drivers, behaviours, levels }` | `products/map/test/exporter.test.js:21-87`, `products/map/test/levels.test.js:71-104`, `products/map/test/view-builders/{skill,capability,others}.test.js`, `products/landmark/test/{readiness,health,marker,snapshot}.test.js`, `tests/model-fixtures.js` (shared across all 12 root tests), `services/pathway/test/service.test.js:31-120` |
| `createTestPerson(overrides?)` | `products/map/test/activity/validate-people.test.js:16-43` and surrounding validation tests |
| `createTestRoster(overrides?)` + `createTestTeamSnapshot(roster, data, teamId)` | `products/summit/test/{coverage,evidence,risks,what-if,trajectory,growth}.test.js` — the `FIXTURE_ROSTER` + `snapshot()` pattern is replicated 7×. |
| `createTestEvidenceRow(overrides?)` | `products/map/test/activity/transform-evidence.test.js:74-100`, `products/landmark/test/{evidence,evidence-helpers,health,timeline}.test.js` (5 sites, identical shape) |
| `createTestSkillWithMarkers()` | `products/landmark/test/{marker,readiness,evidence-helpers}.test.js` |

libharness already exports `createTestLevel[s]`, `createTestDiscipline`,
`createTestSkill[s]`, `createTestTrack`, `createTestCapability`,
`createTestBehaviour[s]` in `src/fixture/pathway.js`. Extend (don't replace)
those with a single top-level `createTestFramework()` and migrate
`libraries/libskill/test/derivation-fixtures.js` to call it, then retire
`makeDiscipline`, `makeLevel`, `makeSeniorLevel`, `makeJuniorLevel`,
`makeSkills`, `makeBehaviours`, `makeCapabilities`, `makeDrivers` from libskill
and `products/landmark/test/**/stubQueries` from landmark.

#### A.2 libeval supervisor / trace helpers

The `libraries/libeval/test/` directory (23 files) contains 10 helpers
duplicated 2–6 times each. Add to libharness as an opt-in `eval` namespace:

| Helper | Call sites |
| --- | --- |
| `createToolUseMsg(name, input)` (replaces `concludeMsg`, `redirectMsg`, `tellMsg`, `shareMsg`) | `supervisor-run.test.js:13-27`, `supervisor-output.test.js:18-48`, `supervisor-batching.test.js:18-48`, `supervisor-intervention.test.js:13-43`, `facilitator.test.js:13-43`, `facilitator-messaging.test.js:14-60` |
| `createTextBlockMsg(text)` | `agent-runner-batching.test.js:20-23`, `supervisor-batching.test.js:13-16` |
| `createTestTrace(overrides?)` (replaces 155-line inline `buildTrace`) | `trace-query.test.js:11-165`, `trace-query-v1.1.test.js:12-36` |
| `createStreamCollector()` → `{ collect, collectLines }` | `tee-writer{,-schema}.test.js`, `fixture-equivalence.test.js` (5 sites) |
| `stripAnsi(s)` | same 3 files |
| `writeLines(writer, lines)` | `tee-writer{,-schema}.test.js` |
| `createMockAgentQuery(messages, onParams?)` async-generator | `agent-runner.test.js:13-20`, `agent-runner-batching.test.js:12-18` |

#### A.3 Graph / RPC / telemetry infra

| Helper | Call sites |
| --- | --- |
| `createGraphIndexFixture({ storageOverrides?, indexKey? })` → `{ n3Store, graphIndex, mockStorage }` | `libgraph/test/index-items.test.js:19`, `libgraph-query.test.js:54`, `prefixes.test.js:50`, `index-loading.test.js:18`, `libgraph-filters.test.js:55` |
| **Use existing** `MockMetadata` (already exported) | replace 4 redefinitions in `libtelemetry/test/{tracer,error}.test.js` |
| `createMockS3Client({ sendFn?, overrides? })` | `libstorage/test/libstorage-s3-ops.test.js:12-48` |
| `createMockSupabaseClient({ from?, insert?, delete?, storage? })` | `products/map/test/activity/transform-{evidence,getdx,people,github}.test.js` (4 files with near-identical `createFakeClient`) |
| `createTurtleTestHelpers()` → `{ parseQuads, findOne, findAll }` | `services/pathway/test/{service,integration,serialize}.test.js` (~100 LOC across 3 files) |
| `createMockGrpcHealthDefinition()` | `libraries/librpc/test/health.test.js` and `products/guide/test/status.test.js` |
| `createReplEnvironment()` bundling readline / process / os / formatter / storage | `libraries/librepl/test/librepl.test.js:11-58` |

#### A.4 CLI / console

| Helper | Call sites |
| --- | --- |
| `withSilentConsole(fn)` | `products/pathway/test/{agent-builder-install,build-packs}.test.js:31-50` (defined twice), useful in CLI tests across libcli and basecamp |
| `createMockProcess()` → `{ env, stdout, stderr, exitCode }` | `libraries/libcli/test/cli.test.js:7-25`, `libutil/test/finder.test.js:14-24` |

#### A.5 Promote existing helpers (no new API needed)

These exist in libharness already but the 67 inline reimplementations prove
the helpers aren't discoverable. Blocking fix: add `CONTRIBUTING.md` section
pointing to the libharness README with an example and add to the
`CHECKLISTS.md` DO-CONFIRM gate "checked libharness before writing a mock."

- `createMockStorage` — reimplemented in `libraries/libutil/test/downloader.test.js:9-44`, `libraries/libstorage/test/libstorage-local.test.js:9-46`, and inline in at least 5 other files.
- `createMockLogger` / `createSilentLogger` — `libraries/libsupervise/test/tree.test.js:8`, `libraries/libutil/test/finder.test.js:14`, `libraries/libutil/test/libutil.test.js:8`.
- `createMockFs` — `products/basecamp/test/kb-manager.test.js:9-80` (sophisticated, could feed back into libharness), `products/basecamp/test/agent-runner.test.js:13-14` uses real tmpdir instead.
- `assertThrowsMessage` / `assertRejectsMessage` — exist, zero adopters.
- `MockMetadata` — exported, redefined 4×.

### B. Speed improvements that aren't libharness moves

#### B.1 Turn on concurrency

`package.json:28` hard-codes `--test-concurrency=0`. Node test runner defaults
to parallel file execution. Flipping to the default (or an explicit number)
should drop wall-clock on 2+ cores materially; the blocker to investigate is
whether some tests share global state (`process.env`, file locks, ports).
Likely culprits to fix first:

- `libraries/libutil/test/logger.test.js` mutates `process.env.DEBUG` and
  `console.error` globally — wrap in a per-file `beforeEach/afterEach`.
- `libraries/librc/test/manager-{start,stop}.test.js` spawns processes.
- `libraries/libconfig/test/libconfig-credentials.test.js` binds a real port
  (only test doing so in libraries).

Expected impact: ~3–5× faster on CI runners with multiple cores.

#### B.2 Eliminate real filesystem I/O in unit tests

The 20 files doing `fs.readFile` / `readFileSync` and the 12 using `mkdtemp`
are mostly unit tests that could use the existing `createMockFs`. The slowest
offenders:

| File | Issue |
| --- | --- |
| `libraries/libsyntheticprose/test/prose-engine.test.js` | 6 tests each `mkdtempSync` + `writeFileSync` + `readFileSync` for cache persistence (~150 LOC). Replace with `createMockFs`. |
| `libraries/libprompt/test/loader.test.js` and `libraries/libtemplate/test/loader.test.js` | Mirror image — both do per-test `mkdtempSync` + `writeFileSync` for 10+ tests. |
| `libraries/libcodegen/test/metadata.test.js:16-42` | Scans `node_modules/@forwardimpact/*/proto` at load time. |
| `products/pathway/test/build-packs.test.js` | Real tar extraction via `execFileSync("tar", …)` in 3 tests. Keep *one* integration test; convert the others to assert against the pre-packed archive. |

#### B.3 Cache fixture data across tests that need real framework data

27 tests call `createDataLoader().loadAllData()` which reads the 11 YAML files
in `products/map/starter/`. Even at 57 KB it adds up × 27 × (parse + derive).
Options:

- Add a libharness `loadStarterFrameworkCached()` that memoizes the load
  across a process, keyed by `starterDir`. Safe because fixtures are
  read-only.
- Replace per-test `loadData()` calls in `products/summit/test/*` with a
  single shared `before()` that loads once per file.

Expected impact: ~30–40% reduction in summit + services/pathway integration
test time.

#### B.4 Split giant test files

52 files are over 300 LOC. The biggest maintenance burden comes from the few
at 400+:

| File | LOC | Split suggestion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `libraries/libeval/test/tee-writer.test.js` | 474 | split schema vs behaviour |
| `libraries/libeval/test/trace-query.test.js` | 460 | introspection vs query vs stats |
| `libraries/libeval/test/supervisor-output.test.js` | 453 | event envelope vs orchestration |
| `libraries/libindex/test/base-filters.test.js` | 450 | by filter family |
| `libraries/libtelemetry/test/visualizer-edge-cases.test.js` | 411 | by edge-case family |

#### B.5 Reduce excessive parametrization

- `libraries/libskill/test/modifiers.test.js` (44 cases) and `policies-predicates.test.js` (46 cases) appear to cross-multiply every proficiency × modifier combination. Audit whether the matrix tests distinct code paths or repeats one implementation detail; keep representative cases per branch.
- `tests/model-types.test.js` (448 LOC) exhaustively iterates proficiency × maturity indices. Replace with a small set of boundary cases plus one property-based check.

### C. Coverage reductions (secondary, after B)

Only take these after the libharness moves so the remaining tests are also
cleaner to maintain. Each removal below was called out by independent
sub-agents as redundant with upstream coverage.

| Candidate | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Merge `libraries/libeval/test/trace-query.test.js` and `trace-query-v1.1.test.js` | Both probe the same `TraceQuery` surface; v1.1 mostly adds schema-specific assertions that can be version-gated subtests in one file. |
| Consolidate 4 `libraries/libeval/test/supervisor-*.test.js` files into 2 | `supervisor-run` + `supervisor-output` + `supervisor-batching` + `supervisor-intervention` share identical mock scaffolding; split by *behaviour* (run/output vs mid-turn control) instead of by *detail*. |
| Remove overlap between `tests/model-matching-*.test.js` and `libraries/libskill/test/matching-*.test.js` | Root matching tests re-exercise `findNextStepJob` / `classifyMatch` / `calculateGapScore` already covered in libskill's own tests. Keep root tests for genuine cross-module integration (`profile-base`, `interview`); delete assertions that duplicate libskill unit tests. |
| Drop `libraries/libsyntheticrender/test/enricher.test.js` IRI-format checks | Covered by `validate.test.js` + `industry-data.test.js` in the same library. |
| Merge `libraries/libsyntheticgen/test/parser.test.js` + `parser-dataset.test.js` overlap | Both parse org/team/department shapes; keep one. |
| Remove regex-based source-file assertions in `products/guide/test/cli.test.js` | Fragile and duplicates what libcli already unit-tests. |
| `libraries/libutil/test/libutil.test.js` (3 tests) | Subsumed by `logger.test.js` (18 tests). |

### D. Docs / process (prevents regression)

1. Add a short "Don't inline a mock" section to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, listing
   the libharness API and saying: if you need a helper that isn't there,
   add it to libharness in the same PR.
2. Add a `<read_do_checklist>` entry in the project-wide test checklist
   (per `CHECKLISTS.md`): *"Checked `libraries/libharness/src/index.js` for
   an existing mock / fixture before writing a new one."*
3. Add a simple eslint rule or `scripts/check-instructions.mjs` lint that
   warns when a test file defines `createMock*` locally and does not import
   from `@forwardimpact/libharness`.

## Non-goals

- No changes to what products do or how they are wired. Only test code.
- No new test framework. Keep `node:test`.
- No rewrite of libharness internals; only additive extensions.

## Open questions

1. What's the right ceiling for coverage reduction? Step C removes maybe
   8–12 test files; are any of those load-bearing for a spec owner?
2. Should the `eval` namespace helpers live in libharness or in a sibling
   `libeval/test-helpers.js` exported for downstream libraries that consume
   libeval? Precedent in `libdoc/test-harness.js`.
3. Is there appetite for property-based testing (fast-check or similar) to
   replace the combinatorial matrices in libskill and root `tests/`?

## Expected outcome

- Local `bun run test` wall-clock: 16 s → ~5 s (parallel + cached framework
  data + fewer tmpdirs).
- Duplicate mock/fixture definitions: ~120 → ~15.
- libharness adoption: 17% → ~80% of test files.
- Test LOC: 45,456 → ~33,000 (≈ 25% reduction) without losing a real code
  path from coverage.
