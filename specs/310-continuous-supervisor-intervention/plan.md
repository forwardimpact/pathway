# Plan — Continuous Supervisor Intervention

## Approach

The current relay is a strict ping-pong between `Supervisor.run()` and
`AgentRunner.run()`/`resume()`: the supervisor only sees the agent's work after
`await this.agentRunner.resume(...)` returns. To let the supervisor intervene
mid-turn we need two things:

1. **An observation hook inside the agent's streaming loop.** The `for await`
   over `query(...)` in `AgentRunner.run()` and `AgentRunner.resume()` must call
   the supervisor at natural boundaries while the agent's SDK session is still
   alive.
2. **A way to cut the agent's SDK session short from the outside.** The
   observation hook needs a signal it can raise to stop the stream cleanly so
   the supervisor's intervention message can be relayed as the agent's next
   prompt via `resume(sessionId)`.

The plan keeps `Supervisor.run()` as the top-level relay driver and
`AgentRunner` as the SDK adapter, but threads a new collaborator between them —
an `onBatch(...)` callback — that makes mid-turn supervision possible without
breaking encapsulation or the existing non-supervised `fit-eval run` path.

### Key design decisions (answers to the spec's open questions)

- **Batching granularity → per agent assistant message.** Flush the batch to
  the supervisor each time the agent emits a message of type `assistant`
  containing a text block (tool-only assistant messages are accumulated into
  the pending batch and flushed with the next text block). This is the
  granularity at which the agent surfaces *intent* in natural language, which
  is what the supervisor needs to judge "is this a dead end?". Per-event
  batching would multiply supervisor cost by 5–20x; per-turn batching is what
  we have today. Per-assistant-message keeps supervisor cost within 2–5x of
  today's per-turn cost in typical evaluations, which is inside the spec's
  "same order of magnitude" bound. A final implicit flush happens at the SDK
  `result` message so the turn-ending review still runs.

- **Supervisor concurrency → serialized (agent paused during supervisor
  evaluation).** While the supervisor runs its LLM call for a batch, the
  agent's `for await` loop is simply not pulling from the SDK generator; the
  SDK session is idle but alive. This is deterministic (critical for tests),
  requires no locks, and matches the mental model documented in
  `product-evaluation/SKILL.md` — the supervisor *watches* the agent, it does
  not race it. True concurrency can be explored in a follow-up spec if
  per-batch latency becomes a measurable problem.

- **Interrupt mechanism → `AbortController` passed in `query()` options.** The
  SDK exposes `abortController?: AbortController` on the options object
  (confirmed in `node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/sdk.d.ts:891`).
  Aborting the controller stops the `for await` loop with an `AbortError` /
  `DOMException` that we catch as a controlled exit. The session is preserved
  server-side (by `session_id` captured in the init message) and
  `AgentRunner.resume(sessionId, newPrompt)` picks up from where it left off —
  the agent keeps its context and continues with the intervention as new input,
  exactly as the spec requires. The `Query.interrupt()` method is only
  available for streaming *input* mode, which we do not use, so
  `AbortController` is the correct choice.

## Concrete changes

### 1. `libraries/libeval/src/supervisor.js` — add `isIntervention`

Alongside `isComplete`, add a parallel detector for the new intervention
signal. Same regex shape, same markdown tolerance, different keyword.

```js
/**
 * Check if the supervisor's response signals a mid-turn intervention.
 * Same tolerance rules as isComplete (markdown formatting, word boundaries).
 */
export function isIntervention(text) {
  return /(?:^|[\s*_~`])EVALUATION_INTERVENTION(?:[\s*_~`.,!?]|$)/m.test(text);
}
```

Export it from `libraries/libeval/index.js` (the package barrel —
`src/index.js` does not exist) alongside `isComplete`.

### 2. `libraries/libeval/src/agent-runner.js` — accept `onBatch` and `abortController`

Extract the body of the existing `for await` loop into a private helper
`#consumeQuery(iterator)` so `run()` and `resume()` share identical
batch/abort handling. Scope is tight: the existing options gap in `resume()`
(it deliberately omits `systemPrompt`, `allowedTools`, etc. because the SDK
preserves them server-side across resumes) is **not** expanded. We only add
`abortController` to both option blocks.

The shared consumer loop:

- Tracks a `pendingBatch` array of raw NDJSON lines emitted since the last
  flush.
- On every iteration, writes the line to `this.output`, pushes to
  `this.buffer`, fires `this.onLine(line)`, and appends to `pendingBatch`
  (exactly the existing side effects — just in one place).
- When the message is `assistant` with at least one text block, or when the
  message is `result`, awaits `this.onBatch(pendingBatch, { abort })` where
  `abort()` calls `this.currentAbortController.abort()`. Clears
  `pendingBatch` after the callback. `onBatch` is a no-op when not set.
- Wraps the iteration in a try/catch that treats an aborted signal as a
  controlled exit. To avoid fragility around `AbortError` vs `DOMException`
  shapes from the SDK, the catch block checks
  `this.currentAbortController?.signal.aborted` — if true, swallow the error
  and set `aborted = true`; otherwise rethrow as before.
- On controlled abort, the method returns
  `{ success: false, text, sessionId, error: null, aborted: true }` so the
  caller can distinguish "supervisor asked us to stop" from "real error".

`run()` and `resume()` both:

- Create a fresh `AbortController`, assign it to
  `this.currentAbortController` before starting the query so the outer
  supervisor (or the `onBatch` callback) can abort it.
- Pass that controller to the SDK via `options.abortController`.
- Call the shared `#consumeQuery` helper.
- Clear `this.currentAbortController` in a `finally` block.

Constructor changes:
- Add `onBatch` to the deps list (optional; defaults to `null`; assignable at
  runtime so the Supervisor can swap it per turn).
- Add `currentAbortController` as an instance field initialised to `null`.

Keep `drainOutput()` and `buffer` unchanged — the existing supervisor
tag/emit path is untouched because every line still writes to `buffer` and
still calls `onLine`. `onBatch` is purely additive.

### 3. `libraries/libeval/src/supervisor.js` — mid-turn loop in `Supervisor.run()`

Replace the body of the existing agent-turn branch inside the `for` loop with
an inner loop that drives the agent through interventions. Pseudocode:

```
for each turn 1..maxTurns:
  relay = extractLastText(supervisorRunner, supervisorResult.text)
  interventions = 0

  // onBatch is assigned once per turn; it closes over `turn` so the inner
  // loop's multiple agentRunner.resume(...) calls all see the same callback.
  agentRunner.onBatch = async (batchLines, { abort }) => {
    // INVARIANT: this callback is awaited synchronously inside the agent's
    // `for await` loop. No queueMicrotask/setImmediate between yielding the
    // previous line and firing onBatch, so no agent line can arrive while
    // currentSource is flipped to "supervisor".
    const batchTranscript = renderBatch(batchLines)

    // Emit the orchestrator marker BEFORE the supervisor LLM call so the
    // trace ordering is:
    //   agent line → orchestrator:mid_turn_review
    //   → supervisor lines (tagged turn:N)
    //   → orchestrator:intervention_requested|continue
    emitOrchestratorEvent({ type: "mid_turn_review", turn })

    currentSource = "supervisor"  // currentTurn stays = turn
    completeSignalSeen = false
    interventionSignalSeen = false
    const supervisorBatchResult = await supervisorRunner.resume(
      `The agent is mid-turn. Latest batch:\n\n${batchTranscript}\n\n` +
      `Respond with a brief acknowledgement to let it continue, or write ` +
      `EVALUATION_INTERVENTION followed by a corrective message to stop ` +
      `and relay a new instruction. Write EVALUATION_COMPLETE only when ` +
      `the task is fully done.`
    )
    currentSource = "agent"

    if (interventionSignalSeen) {
      lastSupervisorResult = supervisorBatchResult
      emitOrchestratorEvent({ type: "intervention_requested", turn })
      abort()
      return
    }
    if (completeSignalSeen) {
      lastSupervisorResult = supervisorBatchResult
      emitOrchestratorEvent({ type: "complete_requested", turn })
      abort()
      return
    }
    // Non-intervention: do nothing; the agent loop will pull the next line.
  }

  while true:
    currentSource = "agent"; currentTurn = turn
    const isFirstAgentCall = (turn === 1 && interventions === 0)
    agentResult = isFirstAgentCall
      ? await agentRunner.run(relay)
      : await agentRunner.resume(relay)

    if (agentResult.error && !agentResult.aborted) {
      emitSummary({ success: false, turns: turn }); return failure
    }

    if (completeSignalSeen) {
      emitSummary({ success: true, turns: turn }); return success
    }

    if (agentResult.aborted && interventionSignalSeen) {
      interventions++
      if (interventions >= MAX_INTERVENTIONS_PER_TURN) {
        emitOrchestratorEvent({ type: "intervention_limit", turn })
        break  // fall through to end-of-turn review
      }
      relay = extractLastText(supervisorRunner, lastSupervisorResult.text)
      emitOrchestratorEvent({ type: "intervention_relayed", turn })
      continue  // resume the agent with the intervention as the next prompt
    }

    // Agent finished its SDK session naturally
    break
  }

  agentRunner.onBatch = null  // detach before the end-of-turn review

  // End-of-turn review (existing behaviour, unchanged)
  agentTranscript = extractTranscript(agentRunner)
  currentSource = "supervisor"; currentTurn = turn
  completeSignalSeen = false
  supervisorResult = await supervisorRunner.resume(
    `The agent reported:\n\n${agentTranscript}\n\n` +
    `Review the agent's work and decide how to proceed.`
  )
  ... existing error + completion checks ...
```

Concrete details:

- **`interventionSignalSeen` flag.** Add it next to `completeSignalSeen`,
  reset at every supervisor invocation, set inside `emitLine` when a
  supervisor assistant text block matches `isIntervention(...)`. This mirrors
  the existing pattern exactly.

- **`lastSupervisorResult` on the Supervisor instance.** The outer while-loop
  needs to read the supervisor's text to build the next relay, but the
  supervisor call now happens inside `onBatch` (a closure). Store the result
  on `this.lastSupervisorResult` from within the callback so the outer loop
  can read it after the abort.

- **Source-flip invariant.** `onBatch` must be called synchronously from
  inside the agent's `for await` loop — i.e. directly after yielding an
  assistant-with-text or result message, with no scheduling gap. The
  `AgentRunner` is the only place that flips `currentSource`; there is
  exactly one `await` point (the `await this.onBatch(...)` inside the
  consumer loop), and while that await is pending, no further lines are
  pulled from the SDK generator, so no agent line can be tagged as
  `source:"supervisor"`. This is load-bearing and documented as a comment
  in the `#consumeQuery` helper.

- **`MAX_INTERVENTIONS_PER_TURN = 5`.** Rationale: the intervention budget
  should be small enough that a looping supervisor burns its quota fast
  (observability — requirement 6) but large enough that a legitimate
  "intervene, observe, intervene again" pattern has headroom. 5 gives room
  for 2–3 genuine corrections plus noise; the outer `maxTurns` budget (20 by
  default) still bounds overall runtime. Not a hot knob; internal constant,
  not a CLI flag.

- **Orchestrator events.** Add an `emitOrchestratorEvent(event)` helper that
  writes `{source:"orchestrator", turn:currentTurn, event}` NDJSON lines.
  Event types emitted by this spec:
  - `mid_turn_review` — written before each mid-turn supervisor call.
  - `intervention_requested` — supervisor wrote `EVALUATION_INTERVENTION`.
  - `intervention_relayed` — the intervention text has been passed to the
    agent as the new prompt.
  - `intervention_limit` — the per-turn intervention budget was hit.
  - `complete_requested` — supervisor wrote `EVALUATION_COMPLETE` mid-turn.
  These are additive — the improvement coach's parser already reads `source`
  and ignores unknown `event.type` values.

- **`renderBatch(batchLines)`.** A small helper that runs the batch lines
  through a fresh `TraceCollector` (same path `extractTranscript` already
  uses) and returns the text, or `"[empty]"` when the batch is empty.

- **Turn tagging during mid-turn review.** `currentTurn` stays equal to the
  agent's turn number and `currentSource` flips to `supervisor` for the
  duration of the mid-turn call. Mid-turn supervisor lines appear tagged
  `{source:"supervisor", turn:N}` and are distinguishable from end-of-turn
  reviews by the surrounding `mid_turn_review` / `intervention_*`
  orchestrator events — which is why those events are emitted *before* the
  supervisor call, not after. The spec requires mid-turn interventions to be
  *visible*, not to introduce a new turn-numbering scheme.

- **Supervisor buffer accumulation is intentional.** The mid-turn
  `extractLastText(supervisorRunner, ...)` call reads
  `supervisorRunner.buffer`, which accumulates across every supervisor
  invocation (mid-turn and end-of-turn) because `drainOutput()` is only
  called by `extractTranscript()` for the *agent* runner. This is
  deliberate: scanning backwards for the last assistant text block returns
  the most recent message regardless of how many mid-turn reviews have
  already happened. No new drain is needed and no duplicate lines will be
  re-emitted — `emitLine` has already written each line exactly once to the
  output stream as it arrived.

### 4. `libraries/libeval/src/supervisor.js` — prompt updates

Update the two system prompt constants:

```js
export const SUPERVISOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT =
  "You supervise another AI agent through a relay. " +
  "You will see the agent's work in batches as it happens; for each batch, " +
  "respond with a brief acknowledgement to let the agent continue, or write " +
  "EVALUATION_INTERVENTION followed by a corrective message to stop the " +
  "agent mid-turn and relay new instructions. " +
  "Only your final message in each response is relayed to the agent. " +
  "Write EVALUATION_COMPLETE when the task is complete.";

export const AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT =
  "You are being supervised by another AI agent. " +
  "The supervisor may interrupt you mid-task with new instructions — treat " +
  "any new prompt from the supervisor as authoritative and adjust course. " +
  "When requirements are ambiguous or you are uncertain, stop and ask a " +
  "clarifying question before proceeding.";
```

The assertions in `supervisor-output.test.js` lines 303-306 (`includes("relay")`
and `includes("EVALUATION_COMPLETE")`) continue to pass because both substrings
remain.

### 5. `libraries/libeval/src/commands/supervise.js` — nothing

No changes needed. The CLI path goes through `createSupervisor(...)` and the
new behaviour is entirely internal to `Supervisor.run()` and `AgentRunner`.

### 6. `libraries/libeval/test/supervisor-run.test.js` — new tests

Extend the mock runner in the existing test file so `run`/`resume` honour an
`onBatch` callback, firing it once per scripted message. Add three new tests
in the `Supervisor - run and turns` describe block:

- **`observation without intervention does not interrupt the agent`** —
  supervisor responds "Keep going." to each batch; agent's SDK session
  completes its scripted turn normally; end-of-turn review then emits
  `EVALUATION_COMPLETE`; result is `{success:true, turns:1}`; the total turn
  count matches what the equivalent scenario produced before this spec.

- **`EVALUATION_INTERVENTION from mid-turn batch interrupts and relays`** —
  supervisor responds `EVALUATION_INTERVENTION stop and do X` to the first
  batch; assert that `agentRunner.resume` is called a second time with the
  intervention text as its prompt (capture via mock), and that the second
  resume call completes the turn; assert the final tagged trace contains an
  orchestrator event with `type: "intervention_requested"` and another with
  `type: "intervention_relayed"`.

- **`EVALUATION_INTERVENTION and EVALUATION_COMPLETE in the same turn`** —
  supervisor intervenes on batch 1, then on the next batch writes
  `EVALUATION_COMPLETE`; assert final result is `{success:true}` and the
  agent's second resume was aborted in favour of the completion path.

### 7. `libraries/libeval/test/supervisor-run.test.js` — `isIntervention` coverage

Add a `describe("isIntervention", ...)` block that mirrors the existing
`isComplete` block: standalone signal, markdown wrappers, inline occurrence,
empty/unrelated text, no match on `EVALUATION_COMPLETE` alone.

### 8. `libraries/libeval/test/supervisor-output.test.js` — trace shape test

Add one test: run a scenario where the supervisor intervenes once, then parse
the NDJSON output and assert:

- At least one line has `source === "orchestrator"` and
  `event.type === "intervention_requested"`.
- At least one agent line and at least one supervisor line share the same
  `turn` value (mid-turn supervisor activity).
- The final summary line is still emitted and still has
  `source === "orchestrator"`, `type === "summary"`.

This protects the improvement coach's parser contract: new event sources /
types are additive, never rename existing ones.

### 9. `.claude/skills/product-evaluation/SKILL.md` — document intervention

Update "Step 2: Supervise the Session" to describe the mid-turn signal. The
current table already lists agent states and responses; add a paragraph
before/after it:

```
You now see the agent's work in streaming batches, not just at the end of
each turn. For each batch you may:

- Write a brief acknowledgement (e.g. "Continue.") to let the agent keep going.
- Write EVALUATION_INTERVENTION followed by a corrective message to stop the
  agent mid-turn and relay new instructions. Use this when the agent is
  heading down a dead end, burning turn budget on the wrong thing, or has
  misread the documentation. The system will interrupt the agent's current
  SDK session and resume it with your message as the next prompt.
- Write EVALUATION_COMPLETE when the task is fully done (Step 3).

Intervene sparingly. The agent's independent struggle is part of the signal;
intervene only when the struggle has become noise.
```

Do **not** restate mechanics that already live in `SUPERVISOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
(per CLAUDE.md / CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT.md's instruction-layering rule). The
skill's job is *when* to intervene; the prompt's job is *how*.

## Ordering

Dependencies force this order:

1. **`isIntervention` + export** — small, self-contained, tested in isolation.
2. **`AgentRunner.onBatch` + `AbortController` plumbing** — no behaviour
   change yet (supervisor doesn't pass `onBatch`, so old tests still pass).
3. **`Supervisor.run()` mid-turn loop + orchestrator events +
   `interventionSignalSeen` flag** — wire the supervisor to use the new
   AgentRunner hooks.
4. **Prompt updates** (`SUPERVISOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) —
   independent of the runtime changes; done last among source changes so
   earlier steps can be verified in isolation.
5. **Tests** — added alongside their corresponding source changes (step 1:
   `isIntervention` tests; step 2: onBatch mock; step 3: the three
   intervention tests + output trace test).
6. **`product-evaluation/SKILL.md`** — documentation, done once behaviour is
   stable.
7. **`bun run check` + `bun run test`** across the libeval package.

## Blast radius

**Modified:**
- `libraries/libeval/src/supervisor.js`
- `libraries/libeval/src/agent-runner.js`
- `libraries/libeval/index.js` (export `isIntervention` — barrel lives at the
  package root, not under `src/`)
- `libraries/libeval/test/supervisor-run.test.js`
- `libraries/libeval/test/supervisor-output.test.js`
- `.claude/skills/product-evaluation/SKILL.md`

**Created:** none.

**Deleted:** none.

**Unchanged (deliberately):**
- `libraries/libeval/src/commands/supervise.js` — CLI surface is untouched.
- `libraries/libeval/src/commands/run.js` — non-supervised path is out of scope.
- `libraries/libeval/src/trace-collector.js` — batch rendering reuses it via
  the existing `extractTranscript` pattern.
- `libraries/libeval/src/tee-writer.js` — output formatting is downstream of
  `Supervisor.output.write()` and sees the new orchestrator events without
  modification.
- Claude Agent SDK version or usage of `query()` streaming.

## Pre-implementation smoke test

Before wiring `onBatch` through `Supervisor.run()`, the implementer must
confirm one SDK-level assumption with a ~20-line disposable script:

- **Does the SDK session survive an `AbortController.abort()` mid-stream and
  continue with full context on `resume(sessionId)`?** Script: start a
  `query()` with a long-running task, abort the controller after the first
  assistant message, then call a second `query({ prompt: "follow up", options: { resume: sessionId } })`
  and confirm the second session sees the first turn's history. If the
  aborted session is not resumable (e.g. the SDK discards the server-side
  checkpoint on abort), the plan needs to fall back to a different interrupt
  mechanism — most likely pushing a sentinel tool-denial and letting the
  turn end naturally. Running this smoke first avoids rewriting the mid-turn
  loop under pressure.

This is the only SDK behaviour the plan cannot verify from the `.d.ts`
surface alone.

## Verification

- `bun run check` passes (lint + format).
- `bun run test --filter=@forwardimpact/libeval` passes, including the new
  intervention tests and all pre-existing `supervisor-run` and
  `supervisor-output` tests.
- Manual smoke: `bunx fit-eval supervise --task-text="..." --output=trace.ndjson`
  on a scenario that is known to dead-end (candidate: `guide-setup`), then
  `grep intervention_requested trace.ndjson` — at least one hit.
- Manual smoke (feature-invisible-when-not-needed): a clean scenario produces
  zero `intervention_requested` events and substantively the same turn count
  as on `master`.
- Improvement coach parser sanity: run `.claude/skills/gemba-walk` over the
  new trace; it should load and display without parser errors.
- Degenerate all-tools turn: the implicit flush at the SDK `result` message
  guarantees the supervisor sees at least one batch per turn even when the
  agent produces only tool calls and no assistant text. Verified by the
  "observation without intervention" test, which uses a result-only mock.
