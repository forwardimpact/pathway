# Spec 600 — Native Binary Distribution via Homebrew

## Problem

External users of Forward Impact products must install Node.js before they can
run any `fit-*` CLI. Today's distribution model states this as policy:

> External users — Node.js + npm, run `npx fit-*`.
>
> — [`CLAUDE.md` § Distribution Model](../../CLAUDE.md)

Every published CLI carries a Node shebang that makes this coupling concrete —
for example, `products/pathway/bin/fit-pathway.js` begins:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

The same is true for `fit-map`, `fit-basecamp`, `fit-guide`, `fit-landmark`,
`fit-summit`, and `fit-codegen`. In practice this produces three costs:

1. **Adoption friction on fresh machines.** A new developer evaluating Forward
   Impact on a clean macOS laptop must first install a Node toolchain (nvm,
   Homebrew, Volta, or a vendor installer) before they can run `npx fit-map`.
   Leadership and engineers doing a first-look evaluation pay a setup tax before
   seeing any product value.
2. **Version coupling to the user's Node.** Our CLIs run under whatever Node the
   user happens to have on `PATH`. Breakages caused by old LTS versions, ESM/CJS
   interop drift, or site-installed shims surface as Forward Impact bugs even
   when the cause is the host Node.
3. **A second post-install step for Guide.** `fit-guide` additionally requires
   `npx fit-codegen --all` after install because its gRPC clients are generated,
   installation-specific, and never bundled in the npm package (see
   [Codegen Internals](../../website/docs/internals/codegen/index.md)). The
   smoothest possible install is "install one thing, run it"; today's Guide path
   needs two.

We want a zero-Node install path for macOS developers that installs a single
bundled executable, runs immediately, and does not drag the user's Node version
into our support surface.

## Proposal

Add a **second distribution channel**, alongside (not replacing) the existing
npm channel. External users keep `npm install` / `npx fit-*` as today; new users
on macOS additionally get a zero-Node option via Homebrew.

Four new capabilities:

1. **macOS `.app` bundle build targets.** Every compiled artifact ships as a
   real macOS `.app` bundle, not a bare Mach-O. Three categories of bundle are
   produced: (a) one per-product bundle for each of the six products, (b) a
   shared bundle containing every gRPC server under `services/`, (c) a shared
   bundle containing every library CLI under `libraries/*` that has a `bin`
   field. Each bundle carries its own `Info.plist`, entitlements, and ad-hoc
   code signature. The exact bundle names, identifiers, and the enumeration of
   library CLIs that go into the shared bundles are design decisions. No Node,
   no Bun, no runtime dependency on user-side tooling.
2. **Release-workflow artifact publishing.** Release automation, triggered on
   release tag, builds the bundles and attaches them to the GitHub release as
   downloadable assets, one `.app.zip` per bundle per target triple. The CI
   platform and workflow layout are design decisions.
3. **Homebrew tap distribution.** A Homebrew tap exposes one cask per bundle: a
   product cask for each of the six products plus one cask for each shared
   bundle. Installing a product cask transitively installs the two shared-bundle
   casks, and every `fit-*` CLI the bundles surface ends up on the user's
   `PATH`. Tap location, cask names, and the specific Homebrew stanzas used are
   design decisions.
4. **macOS TCC compatibility.** Each bundle carries a stable, content-hash-
   independent designated requirement across rebuilds, is ad-hoc signed with
   Hardened Runtime enabled, and declares the entitlements bun's JavaScriptCore
   JIT needs. Bundles whose executables access TCC-gated resources (Calendar,
   Contacts, etc.) also carry the usage-description strings macOS requires
   before prompting. Adding Developer ID signing and notarization in a follow-up
   spec is a drop-in **replacement of the signing identity**, not a rebuild of
   the metadata layer.

The intent is deliberately narrow: preserve every existing install path,
behaviour, and CLI surface unchanged, and add one new way to get the same
executables onto a macOS machine without installing Node.

## Scope

### Included

- Every `fit-*` CLI listed in the Problem section plus every gRPC service under
  `services/` and every library CLI under `libraries/*` with a `bin` field is
  reachable through the new channel — either as the primary executable of a
  per-product bundle, or as a named Mach-O inside one of the two shared bundles.
- macOS arm64 as the primary and required target at acceptance.
- A release automation workflow that builds the bundles on release tag and
  attaches them to the GitHub release.
- A Homebrew tap with one cask per bundle (six product casks plus the two
  shared-bundle casks).
- Documentation of the brew install flow on the per-product Overview pages
  linked from [`CLAUDE.md` § Products](../../CLAUDE.md) for every affected
  product.
- A zero-second-step install for `fit-guide`. A brew-installed `fit-guide` must
  be usable immediately after install with no additional command from the user —
  no `npm install`, no `npx fit-codegen`, no PATH-dependent toolchain step. The
  mechanism (whether generated artifacts ship inside the binary, whether
  `fit-codegen` is invoked transparently, or another approach) is a design
  decision.

### Excluded (explicit non-goals)

- **Windows support.** Not in this spec. A separate spec can revisit after the
  macOS path is proven.
- **Linux distribution.** Whether Linux users get Linuxbrew, apt/dnf packaging,
  raw tarballs, or none of the above is out of scope. Linux users continue via
  the existing npm channel for now.
- **Apple Developer ID signing and notarization.** Obtaining a paid Developer ID
  certificate, running `notarytool submit`, stapling, and the Gatekeeper-clean
  first-run experience are deferred to a follow-up spec. This spec lands
  **ad-hoc** signing (`codesign --sign -`) on every bundle with correct
  entitlements and `Contents/Info.plist`, so the follow-up is a signing-identity
  swap only. Unsigned-by-Apple bundles still trigger Gatekeeper warnings on
  first run, which the user must acknowledge. This spec must not claim Developer
  ID signing as complete.
- **TCC prompts for resources no current CLI accesses.** Only `fit-basecamp`
  requests Calendar, Contacts, and Downloads today. The other bundles ship with
  the minimal JIT entitlement set and no usage-description strings. Adding new
  TCC-gated resources to any CLI is a per-bundle change, not a spec-600 concern.
- **Fixing Terminal-inherited TCC responsibility for PATH symlinks.** Capability
  #3 requires that every CLI still be invokable from Terminal through the cask's
  `binary` symlink; that is in scope and must work. What is **out** of scope is
  changing which process macOS considers TCC-responsible in that case: when the
  CLI launches via the symlink, Terminal (not the bundle) is the responsible
  process, which only matters for CLIs that actively request TCC-gated resources
  like Calendar or Contacts. No non-basecamp CLI does so today, and
  `fit-basecamp`'s scheduler is launched by the `fit-basecamp.app` bundle rather
  than from Terminal, so its TCC grants already attach to the bundle correctly.
  Adding a self-disclaim helper for a future Terminal-invoked TCC-gated CLI is
  deferred.
- **Replacing or modifying the existing npm channel.** `npm install` /
  `npx fit-*` continues to work identically. No CLI is removed from npm, no
  shebang is rewritten, and no existing user workflow changes.
- **Auto-update mechanism inside the binaries.** Users upgrade via
  `brew upgrade`; in-process self-update is not in scope.

## Success Criteria

1. A single documented build entry point produces a standalone macOS arm64
   release artifact for each of the eight bundles in scope (six per-product plus
   the two shared bundles). Every `fit-*` CLI surfaced by those bundles runs its
   `--help` successfully on a macOS arm64 machine that has neither `node` nor
   `bun` on `PATH`.
2. A release-automation workflow, triggered by a release tag, builds the
   artifact for that tag and attaches it to the GitHub release as a downloadable
   asset, with a deterministic asset-name scheme that identifies the bundle and
   target triple.
3. A Homebrew tap contains one cask per bundle. Each cask references the GitHub
   release artifact for that bundle and target triple, and product casks declare
   a dependency on the two shared-bundle casks so installing a product cask
   delivers the full runtime.
4. On a clean macOS arm64 machine with Homebrew installed but no Node and no
   Bun, running the brew install command published on each affected product's
   Overview page leaves every `fit-*` CLI surfaced by the bundles on the user's
   `PATH`, each answering `--help`. The concrete tap path and cask names are
   fixed by design.
5. After installing `fit-guide` exclusively via brew — no npm, no post-install
   command — the user can run `fit-guide --help` and every user-visible command
   documented in the [Guide Overview](../../website/guide/index.md) with no
   additional install step. No `fit-codegen` invocation, `npm install`, or
   toolchain step is required from the user between `brew install` and first
   successful command.
6. Every per-product Overview page linked from
   [`CLAUDE.md` § Products](../../CLAUDE.md) for a CLI in scope carries a
   "Install" section (or equivalent) that documents the brew install command
   alongside the existing npm flow.
7. The existing npm distribution is unchanged: for each of the seven CLIs,
   `npm install` followed by `npx fit-<cli> --help` succeeds on a reference Node
   LTS environment after the release that ships the brew channel. No `bin`
   script, `package.json` `bin` entry, or shebang has changed.
8. **Stable bundle identity.** Rebuilding any bundle from the same source tree
   and re-installing via `brew upgrade` on a machine that previously granted it
   a TCC permission keeps the grant — the user is not re-prompted. The bundle's
   designated-requirement identity is stable across rebuilds of the same commit.
9. **Entitlements and Info.plist present on every bundle.** Every bundle carries
   a `Contents/Info.plist` declaring a bundle identifier and a version string
   matching the release tag, and is ad-hoc signed with an entitlements set that
   unlocks bun's JavaScriptCore JIT under Hardened Runtime. The exact identifier
   scheme, entitlement keys, and verification commands are design decisions.
10. **`fit-basecamp` TCC responsibility chain intact.** Basecamp's existing
    Calendar and Contacts integration continues to work after migrating to the
    shared bundle-assembly recipe, and its scheduler still disclaims TCC
    responsibility when spawning `claude`. Verified by a manual hardware test on
    macOS 14+ that launches the rebuilt bundle, triggers a calendar sync, and
    observes no TCC prompt plus a responsible-process lookup that resolves to
    the basecamp bundle (specific `log stream` predicate is a plan decision).
11. **Homebrew cask install surfaces every CLI on `PATH`.** After the documented
    `brew install` command for any product cask runs on a clean macOS arm64
    machine, every `fit-*` CLI surfaced by that product and by the two shared
    bundles that `depends_on` pulls in is on the user's `PATH` and answers
    `--help`. The specific `/Applications/…` install location and the
    PATH-symlink directory are Homebrew-prefix dependent and are design
    decisions, not acceptance literals.

## Open questions

Each item below is a decision the design must make; none block the spec.

- **Cross-compile strategy.** Build natively on macOS arm64 runners only
  (single-arch matrix), or matrix across multiple runner architectures for
  future-proofing. Affects workflow cost and cross-compile risk.
- **Signing and notarization timing.** Defer entirely to a follow-up spec (this
  spec's current stance) vs. land a minimal signed-but-unnotarized path now.
  Design must document the user-visible Gatekeeper experience under whichever
  option is chosen.
- **Tap repository location.** A separate Forward Impact tap repo published to
  from this monorepo, vs. a tap subdirectory inside the monorepo that a release
  job syncs outward. Affects release automation and tap discoverability.
- **Version sync between npm and brew.** How a release tag that publishes to npm
  also updates package hashes and version strings in the tap — one workflow, two
  workflows, or a follow-up job. Design must state the mechanism so a single
  release does not leave the two channels on different versions.
- **Non-arm64 macOS and Linux behaviour.** Whether `brew install` on a non-arm64
  macOS machine or on Linuxbrew fails fast with a clear message, falls back to
  advising the npm path, or ships an Intel/Linux build. The spec requires
  arm64-only at acceptance; the failure mode on other architectures is a design
  decision.
- **`fit-guide` codegen mechanism.** The spec requires zero second-step install
  for `fit-guide`; the design chooses between bundling generated artifacts into
  the binary, having `fit-guide` invoke a bundled `fit-codegen` transparently,
  or another approach. Affects offline usability and artifact size.
