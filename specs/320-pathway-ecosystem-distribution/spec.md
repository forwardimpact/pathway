# 320 — Pathway Ecosystem Distribution for Agents and Skills

Pathway today has exactly one way to put agents and skills in front of an
engineer: `curl -fsSL https://<org>/install.sh | bash`. That script installs
`@forwardimpact/pathway` globally via npm, downloads `bundle.tar.gz`, extracts
its `data/` directory into `~/.fit/data/pathway/` (and its `package.json` into
`~/.fit/data/package.json`), and leaves the engineer to run
`fit-pathway agent <discipline> --track=<track> --output=./agents` to derive a
Claude Code agent team. It works, but it is the only door. Engineers who want
to use emerging ecosystem tools — Vercel's `npx skills add <source>`,
Microsoft's Agentic Package Manager (APM) — cannot reach Pathway agents or
skills through those tools. Pathway is invisible to the package managers that
engineers are beginning to reach for first.

This spec proposes adding a second distribution surface, served from the same
static site that already hosts `install.sh` and `bundle.tar.gz`. The new
surface exposes pre-generated agent/skill packs in a format that both
`npx skills` and APM can install directly, so an engineer can adopt a Pathway
agent team without ever running the Pathway CLI.

## Why

### One distribution path is a reach problem

The current install flow assumes the engineer already knows about Pathway and
is willing to pipe a shell script. Engineers adopting agentic tools are
increasingly starting from the package manager their editor or team already
uses. If the first question an engineer asks is "does my skill manager have
this?" and the answer is no, Pathway is not considered further. The gap is not
in what Pathway can generate — `fit-pathway agent` already produces
Claude Code-format agent profiles and SKILL.md files with full team
instructions — it is in how those artefacts get to the engineer.

### Ecosystem tools are converging on a shared shape

Both `npx skills` and APM expect the publisher to host something the tool can
fetch: a manifest that lists available packs, and a downloadable archive per
pack containing the agent/skill files plus metadata. The shapes differ in
naming and JSON structure, but the underlying artefact — a directory of
SKILL.md files and an agent profile with a small manifest — is close enough
that a single build can satisfy both if the spec is designed with both in mind
from the start.

### The build pipeline is already where this belongs

`fit-pathway build` (`products/pathway/src/commands/build.js`) already renders
the static site, generates `bundle.tar.gz`, and renders `install.sh` from a
template when `framework.distribution.siteUrl` is configured. Adding agent/skill
pack generation to the same command — same inputs, same output directory —
keeps the publishing story coherent: one `bun run build`, one deploy, one
origin hosting everything an engineer needs regardless of how they arrive.

### Pathway already knows the packs

`fit-pathway agent --list` enumerates every valid discipline/track combination.
For each combination, `fit-pathway agent <discipline> --track=<track>
--output=<dir>` already produces exactly the set of files that belongs in a
pack: the agent profile per stage, the derived skill files, the team
instructions, and the Claude Code settings. The work in this spec is to loop
over the valid combinations at build time, capture each output as a pack, wrap
it in the manifest shapes the ecosystem tools expect, and publish the result
alongside `install.sh`.

## What

Extend the Pathway build output so the same static site that hosts `install.sh`
also hosts a discoverable set of pre-generated agent/skill packs, each
installable by both `npx skills` and Microsoft APM without any additional
Pathway tooling on the engineer's machine.

### Requirements

1. **Pre-generated packs, one per valid agent combination.** `fit-pathway
   build` must generate one installable pack per valid discipline/track
   combination returned by the existing agent-listing logic. Each pack contains
   the agent profile files for every stage, the derived skill files, the
   interpolated team instructions, and the Claude Code settings — the same
   artefacts `fit-pathway agent <discipline> --track=<track> --output=<dir>`
   produces today.

2. **A single discoverable endpoint serves both tools.** The published site
   must expose a registry/index that both `npx skills` and APM can parse to
   discover the available packs. A single source of truth is required — the
   generator may emit multiple manifest files (one shaped for each tool) but
   they must be derived from the same underlying list, so adding a new pack
   cannot desync the two views. An engineer pointing either tool at the
   Pathway site URL must see the same set of packs.

3. **Packs install cleanly through the target tools.** Pointing `npx skills add
   <pathway-site-url>` at the published site must install a pack's contents
   into the engineer's project in the location the tool expects (typically
   `.claude/skills/` or equivalent). Pointing APM at the same site using its
   documented discovery mechanism must install the same pack's contents into
   the location APM expects. "Installed" means the files land in the right
   place and the tool reports success — no post-install fixups required.

4. **Content parity with the CLI path.** A pack installed via `npx skills` or
   APM must contain the same agent profile, skills, team instructions, and
   Claude Code settings that `fit-pathway agent <discipline> --track=<track>
   --output=<dir>` produces for the same combination. If the CLI path gains or
   changes a file, the pack path must reflect the change after the next build.

5. **Served from the existing static site.** The new manifests and pack
   archives must be emitted into the same output directory as
   `install.sh`/`bundle.tar.gz` and deploy to the same origin. No new hosting
   target, no new deploy pipeline. URLs referenced inside the manifests must
   resolve relative to `framework.distribution.siteUrl`, the same setting
   `install.sh` already uses.

6. **Build remains a single command.** `fit-pathway build` must produce the
   packs and manifests alongside the existing outputs when
   `framework.distribution.siteUrl` is configured. A separate command or flag
   is acceptable only if the default `build` still emits the packs — the aim
   is that existing deploys light up the new surface without any workflow
   change.

7. **Versioned, reproducible packs.** Each pack and each manifest entry must
   carry the Pathway version that produced it (the same version `install.sh`
   pins). Two builds of the same framework data at the same Pathway version
   must produce byte-identical packs, so caches and CDN behaviour remain sane.

8. **The existing install.sh path continues to work unchanged.** Engineers who
   want the full `fit-pathway` CLI on their machine must still get it from
   `curl | bash`. This spec adds a surface; it does not remove one. No change
   to `install.template.sh`, `bundle.tar.gz`, or the CLI.

### Success criteria

1. After `fit-pathway build` runs against the Pathway starter data with a
   configured `siteUrl`, the output directory contains: a registry/index file
   consumable by both `npx skills` and APM, and one pack archive per valid
   discipline/track combination returned by `fit-pathway agent --list`.

2. Running `npx skills add <deployed-site-url>` against the deployed site
   discovers the packs, lets the engineer pick one, and installs it into the
   expected skills directory of the current project. The installed files match
   the output of `fit-pathway agent <discipline> --track=<track> --output=<dir>`
   for the same combination.

3. Running APM against the deployed site lists the same set of packs and
   installs the selected pack's contents into the location APM expects. The
   installed files match the CLI output for the same combination. The exact
   APM command and discovery mechanism are resolved during planning against
   APM's current public documentation; this spec only requires that whatever
   single-URL discovery APM supports at planning time must work here without
   asking the engineer to configure anything beyond the Pathway site URL.

4. `curl -fsSL <deployed-site-url>/install.sh | bash` still installs
   `@forwardimpact/pathway` and downloads `bundle.tar.gz` with the same
   behaviour as before this spec.

5. Bumping the Pathway version in `products/pathway/package.json` and
   re-running `fit-pathway build` produces pack archives and manifest entries
   that reference the new version. The same version and input data produce
   byte-identical outputs on a repeat build.

6. Adding a new discipline/track combination to the framework data and
   re-running `fit-pathway build` adds a new pack and manifest entry without
   any manual step in between.

## Out of Scope

- **Submitting Pathway to a central registry.** If either tool maintains a
  central index, listing Pathway there is a separate effort. This spec only
  requires that a site-URL-based install works.
- **New agent/skill content.** The packs contain whatever `fit-pathway agent`
  already produces. This spec does not change derivation, add new stages, or
  alter skill shape.
- **A Pathway-specific package manager.** Pathway is not building its own
  installer CLI. It only hosts the artefacts other tools consume.
- **Per-engineer customisation at install time.** Packs are pre-generated at
  build time. Engineers who want custom combinations still use the existing
  `fit-pathway agent` CLI path.
- **Authentication or private distribution.** The existing site is a public
  static deploy. Private hosting, access tokens, or per-user licensing are not
  in scope.
- **Deprecation of `install.sh`.** Confirmed: the new surface supplements,
  does not replace, the current curl|bash path.
- **Packs for non-agent Pathway outputs** (e.g. job descriptions, interview
  questions). Only agent/skill packs are in scope.
- **Changes to the underlying framework data or to `fit-map`.** Only the
  Pathway build command and its output directory are affected.
