# Spec 730 — Dependabot ↔ `.github/actions/` directory sync

## Problem

`.github/dependabot.yml` requires manual enumeration of every directory under
`.github/actions/` in its `directories:` list (currently 5 action-directory
entries plus the workflow-root `/`). Whenever composite actions are added,
renamed, or deleted, this list silently falls out of sync with the filesystem
and the new path goes unscanned by Dependabot — opening a supply-chain
coverage blind spot until the next audit catches it.

The same compliance mechanism has now failed three times in 30 days, all
sharing the same root cause — per-directory enumeration drifting from the
filesystem:

| #   | Date       | Event                                                                                                                                                                          | Reference                                          |
| --- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 2026-04-27 | Original blind spot — `actions/upload-artifact@v4` in `.github/actions/kata-action/` 3 majors stale, no auto-bump PRs ever proposed (config only listed `/`, not action dirs).  | Closed by PR #551 — added explicit `directories:`. |
| 2   | 2026-04-29 | Re-introduction — commit `0194cb0f` ("simplify workflows…") split `kata-action/` into `kata-action-agent/` + `kata-action-eval/`. `dependabot.yml` not updated in the same PR. | Both new directories unscanned.                    |
| 3   | 2026-04-30 | Surfacing — Dependabot auto-closed PR #556 ("`actions/upload-artifact` 4.6.2 → 7.0.1 in /.github/actions/kata-action") because the targeted path no longer exists.             | Hand-fixed by PR #615.                             |

The fix in #615 restores coverage but does not change the underlying mechanism
— a fourth recurrence is on the same trajectory the moment the next composite
action lands or moves. Three identical failures in 30 days under the
contributors-must-remember model is sufficient evidence that the mechanism
layer, not the policy layer, is where this needs to be addressed.

## Goal

Adding, renaming, or deleting a `.github/actions/<dir>/` directory must not
silently leave that directory unscanned by Dependabot, **without** requiring a
new manual step in the contributor's workflow.

## Scope (in)

- `.github/dependabot.yml` — the mechanism by which `.github/actions/<dir>/`
  entries are tracked for the `github-actions` ecosystem.
- The merge-gate behaviour for PRs that add, rename, or delete a directory
  under `.github/actions/` — such PRs must not be able to land while leaving
  Dependabot's scan set out of sync with the filesystem. The artefacts the
  design changes to enforce this are design's choice.

## Scope (out)

- The `npm` / `bun` ecosystem block (`minor-and-patch` grouping, schedule,
  `open-pull-requests-limit`) — unchanged.
- The `schedule:` cadence, `enable-beta-ecosystems`, or any other unrelated
  Dependabot config field.
- Workflow-file scanning at `/` (the root entry must remain — workflows under
  `.github/workflows/` continue to be covered as today).
- The composite actions themselves (their pinning, their version bumps).
- Any change to action-pinning policy or SHA-pin enforcement.

## Success criteria

Define the **filesystem set** as the set of directories `D` for which
`.github/actions/<D>/action.yml` or `.github/actions/<D>/action.yaml` exists
in the repository tree. Define the **scan set** as the list of paths in the
`directories:` field of the `github-actions` ecosystem block of
`.github/dependabot.yml`, with any glob patterns expanded against the
repository tree at merge time. The **coverage invariant** is `filesystem set
⊆ scan set` AND `(scan set ∖ {/}) ⊆ filesystem set` — every action directory
is scanned, and no scan-set entry under `.github/actions/` points at a
non-existent directory.

## Notes

### Replay tests

Criteria 2–4 are verifiable today by replaying the deltas of the three
recorded incidents against the post-change repository:

- **Incident #1 → criterion 2**: re-applying the `kata-action/` introduction
  delta.
- **Incident #2 → criteria 2 + 3**: re-applying the `0194cb0f` split.
- **Incident #3 → criterion 4**: re-applying the `kata-action/` deletion
  delta.

If the post-change repository handles all three replays without a coverage
gap, the spec is met.

### Handoff context for design

Staff-engineer surfaced two candidate levers when handing this spec over (see
`wiki/security-engineer-2026-W18.md` § 2026-04-30 and the facilitator brief
that initiated this spec). The design phase picks one, verifies feasibility,
and documents the trade-offs. The success criteria above are agnostic to the
selection.
