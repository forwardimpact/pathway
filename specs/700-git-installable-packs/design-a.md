# Design A — Git-Installable Pack Repos

## Overview

Add a single architectural primitive
`emitBareRepo(stagedTree, version, targetDir)` to the pack pipeline and reuse it
twice per pack: once for the APM staging tree (→ `packs/{name}.apm.git/`) and
once for the skills-channel tree (→ `packs/{name}.skills.git/`). The existing
`framework.distribution.siteUrl` gate continues to control all per-pack output;
when it is unset, no `.git/` directories are emitted.

The agent-builder install UI surfaces two new command cards (`apm install <url>`
and `git clone <url>`) alongside the existing three. Tarballs and the
`.well-known/skills/` discovery index keep their current bytes.

## Components

| Component                             | Lives in                        | Responsibility                                                                                         | New / Changed                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `emitBareRepo`                        | new module `build-packs-git.js` | Take a staged tree + version, produce a static bare git repo with deterministic SHAs                   | new                            |
| `generatePacks`                       | `build-packs.js`                | Orchestrates per-pack channels; calls `emitBareRepo` twice per pack inside the existing `siteUrl` gate | changed (additive)             |
| Install UI                            | `agent-builder-install.js`      | Adds two command cards: APM-git and skills-git                                                         | changed (two additional cards) |
| `framework.distribution.siteUrl` gate | `generatePacks`                 | Single switch controlling all per-pack output, including the new `.git/` dirs                          | unchanged                      |

The APM working tree is the existing `stageApmBundle` output directory and the
skills working tree is the existing per-pack `packs/{name}/.well-known/skills/`
directory (including `index.json`). Both are consumed by `emitBareRepo` as
read-only inputs — no new staging tree is introduced.

### `emitBareRepo` contract

| Field        | Value                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inputs       | `stagedTree` (absolute path, must exist and be a directory tree of regular files); `version` (semver string used for the tag and commit message); `targetDir` (absolute path, must not exist) |
| Output       | `targetDir/` populated with the bare-repo layout below                                                                                                                                        |
| Error mode   | Throws on any underlying failure; partial output is removed before re-throwing so the caller's `siteUrl`-gated loop fails fast and leaves no half-written `.git/` directory                   |
| Side effects | Writes only under `targetDir`; no global state, no network                                                                                                                                    |

## Data Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[generatePacks loop, per combination] --> B[writePackFiles → packDir]
  B --> C[stageApmBundle → apmStagingDir]
  B --> D[archiveRawPack → packs/name.raw.tar.gz]
  C --> E[archiveApmPack → packs/name.apm.tar.gz]
  C --> F[emitBareRepo → packs/name.apm.git/]
  B --> G[writeSkillsPack → packs/name/.well-known/skills/]
  G --> H[emitBareRepo → packs/name.skills.git/]
```

The whole loop runs only when `framework.distribution.siteUrl` is set; nothing
is emitted when the gate is closed. Both `emitBareRepo` calls feed off
directories that already exist for the tarball and discovery channels — no new
staging tree is introduced and no existing tree is restructured.

## Bare-Repo Layout

Each emitted `.git/` directory is a frozen single-commit bare repo that clones
correctly over plain HTTP from any static file host (dumb HTTP only, no smart
HTTP, no CGI). Layout:

| Path                           | Contents                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HEAD`                         | `ref: refs/heads/main\n`                                                                                                                        |
| `config`                       | minimal bare config (`bare = true`, `repositoryformatversion = 0`)                                                                              |
| `description`                  | `Pathway pack: {name}\n`                                                                                                                        |
| `info/refs`                    | sorted lexicographically by ref name; one line per ref shaped `<sha>\t<ref>`; lightweight tags appear as the commit SHA with no `^{}` peel line |
| `objects/info/packs`           | `P pack-<sha>.pack\n` (single line, single pack)                                                                                                |
| `objects/pack/pack-<sha>.pack` | one pack containing every commit/tree/blob/tag for the single commit                                                                            |
| `objects/pack/pack-<sha>.idx`  | matching index                                                                                                                                  |
| `packed-refs`                  | header `# pack-refs with: peeled fully-peeled sorted \n` followed by sorted `<sha> <ref>` lines                                                 |

The list is exhaustive — no `refs/heads/`, `refs/tags/`, loose-object, or
sub-pack directories beyond `objects/info/` and `objects/pack/` are emitted.
Clients negotiate branches and tags from `info/refs` plus `packed-refs`, and
objects from `objects/info/packs` plus the pack/idx pair — the dumb-HTTP fetch
order described in the Git HTTP protocol spec.

## Determinism Contract

The contract extends today's tarball byte-equality: identical input → identical
bytes across every emitted file in the bare repo, including the commit SHA and
packfile bytes (Spec SC4).

| Field                           | Pinned value                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commit author / committer name  | `Forward Impact Pathway`                                                  |
| Commit author / committer email | `pathway@forwardimpact.team`                                              |
| Commit author / committer date  | epoch (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`)                                            |
| Commit message                  | `pathway v{version}\n`                                                    |
| Default branch                  | `main`                                                                    |
| Tag                             | lightweight `v{version}` ref-only — no tag object emitted in the pack     |
| Pack input order                | objects fed to pack-objects in deterministic SHA order                    |
| Pack contents                   | every commit/tree/blob; no delta reuse from any prior pack or source repo |
| `description` file              | `Pathway pack: {name}\n`                                                  |
| `config` file                   | minimal bare config, fixed key order                                      |
| `info/refs`, `packed-refs`      | sorted lexicographically by ref name                                      |
| `objects/info/packs`            | sorted by pack basename                                                   |

## Install UI Changes

Two new command cards are added to `createInstallSection`. Order is read-time
useful: most-canonical first.

| Card label                  | Channel          | URL                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| _existing_ Direct download  | raw              | `<site>/packs/{name}.raw.tar.gz` |
| _existing_ Microsoft APM    | apm-tarball      | `<site>/packs/{name}.apm.tar.gz` |
| **new** Microsoft APM (git) | apm-git          | `<site>/packs/{name}.apm.git`    |
| _existing_ npx skills       | skills-discovery | per-pack `.well-known/skills/`   |
| **new** Git clone (skills)  | skills-git       | `<site>/packs/{name}.skills.git` |

Existing card commands are unchanged. The two new cards run `apm install <url>`
and `git clone <url>` against the URLs above.

No existing card is removed (Spec Requirement 7 coexistence clause).

## Out of Scope

Design honors the spec's Out-of-Scope list (single commit per build, dumb-HTTP
only, no auth surface, no client tooling changes, no CDN cache opinions). See
`spec.md` § Out of Scope.
