The Kata Agent Team is an autonomous, continuously improving agent team that
operates across six surfaces — IDE, scheduled shifts, GitHub Issues, GitHub PRs,
GitHub Discussions, and Microsoft Teams — using the same harness (`libeval`),
the same shared memory (`libwiki`), the same agent profiles, and the same
skills. All execution runs securely inside GitHub Actions. The team is organized
as a daily **Plan-Do-Study-Act** (PDSA) cycle where agents plan by writing
specs, ship features, study their own traces, and act on findings.

Kata is an implementation of two upstream standards: the repository structure
in [MONOREPO.md](MONOREPO.md) and the instruction architecture in
[COALIGNED.md](COALIGNED.md). Everything below assumes both.

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    SU["Surfaces"] --> H["Harness<br/>libeval"] --> A["Agents<br/>.claude/agents/"] --> S["Skills<br/>.claude/skills/"]
    H --> M["Memory<br/>libwiki + wiki/"]
```

**Surfaces** are the entry points — IDE sessions, cron schedules, GitHub
events, and bridge-relayed messages. The **Harness** (`libeval`) provides the
orchestration loop, async coordination primitives (`Ask`/`Answer`/`Announce`),
role-based tool surfaces, and NDJSON trace capture. **Agents** define persona,
scope, and skill composition. **Skills** define procedures, checklists, and
domain knowledge. **Memory** (`libwiki` + `wiki/`) persists state across
surfaces and sessions.

Local composite actions under `.github/actions/` encapsulate shared CI steps:
`audit/` and `coaligned-check/`. Five external composite actions are published
under `forwardimpact/`: `forwardimpact/fit-benchmark` (coding-agent
benchmarks), `forwardimpact/fit-bootstrap` (the FIT CI environment),
`forwardimpact/fit-eval` (agent task execution),
`forwardimpact/fit-wiki` (agent-memory commands with fresh App token), and
`forwardimpact/kata-agent` (full Kata workflow: auth, checkout, bootstrap,
eval, wiki push). All are consumed by tag (e.g. `@v1`). Run `kata-setup` to
generate workflows interactively.

## Simplicity

A differentiating factor of the Kata Agent Team is its simplicity.

- **15 curated skills** (excluding the setup utility), each under 3k tokens
  (~200 lines of text). Small enough to read in full, audit in minutes.
- **No additional infrastructure.** All core surfaces work with only skills and
  GitHub Actions — no databases, no queues, no custom servers.
- **Minimal harness.** The orchestration layer is built around the Claude SDK —
  simple yet incredibly capable.
- **Zero external runtime dependencies.** JavaScript libraries (`libeval`,
  `libwiki`, etc.) are plain JavaScript with no third-party packages.

## Surfaces

The same agents operate across six surfaces. Each surface routes to the agent
team through one of three mechanisms: direct invocation, scheduled workflow, or
bridge-dispatched workflow.

| Surface               | Mechanism         | Entry workflow     |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| **IDE**               | Direct invocation | —                  |
| **Scheduled shifts**  | Cron              | `kata-shift`       |
| **GitHub Issues**     | Event trigger     | `kata-dispatch`    |
| **GitHub PRs**        | Event trigger     | `kata-dispatch`    |
| **GitHub Discussions**| Bridge dispatch   | `kata-dispatch`    |
| **MS Teams channels** | Bridge dispatch   | `kata-dispatch`    |

**Direct invocation** — IDE sessions run agents locally against the same
profiles and skills.

**Scheduled workflows** — `kata-shift` runs the full roster three times daily;
`kata-storyboard` runs the daily meeting; `kata-coaching` runs on demand.

**Event-triggered workflows** — `kata-dispatch` fires on issue and PR activity
(opened, labeled, commented, reviewed, merged).

**Bridge-dispatched workflows** — `ghbridge` fronts GitHub Discussion webhooks;
`msbridge` fronts Microsoft Teams conversations. Both build on `libbridge` for
the shared callback registry, durable per-thread state, and resume-trigger
contract. The bridge acknowledges on the channel, fires `kata-dispatch` via
`workflow_dispatch`, and posts the agent's reply back to the thread. Suspended
conversations (`Recess` in `libeval` discuss mode) resume when the trigger
condition is met.

## The PDSA Loop

Every workflow belongs to a PDSA phase. Findings from Study always re-enter
the loop — nothing is observed without downstream action.

```mermaid
graph LR
    P["Plan"] --> D["Do"] --> S["Study"] --> A["Act"] --> P
```

- **Plan** — Turn approved `spec.md` (WHAT/WHY) into `design-a.md` (WHICH/WHERE)
  then `plan-a.md` (HOW/WHEN) with steps, files, sequencing, risks.
- **Do** — Execute plans via implementation PRs; run scheduled workflows that
  harden, release, and maintain. Every run captures a trace.
- **Study** — Analyze Do outputs across four streams: security audits, external
  feedback triage, one-topic-deep doc review, one-trace-deep grounded theory.
- **Act** — Trivial findings become **pushed fix PRs**; structural findings
  become `spec.md` documents on **pushed spec branches**. A local commit is not
  a PR — the URL is the only valid completion signal. `fix/` and `spec/`
  branches never mix.

## Agents

Six personas with explicit scope constraints — when a finding exceeds scope, the
agent writes a spec rather than attempting the fix.

| Agent                 | Phase          | Purpose                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **staff-engineer**    | Plan, Do       | Own the full spec -> design -> plan -> implement arc for approved specs |
| **release-engineer**  | Do             | Keep PR branches merge-ready, repair trivial CI, cut releases           |
| **security-engineer** | Do, Study, Act | Patch dependencies, harden supply chain, enforce security policies      |
| **product-manager**   | Study, Act     | Triage issues, review spec quality, run evaluations                     |
| **technical-writer**  | Study, Act     | Review docs for accuracy, curate wiki, fix staleness, spec gaps         |
| **improvement-coach** | Study          | Facilitate storyboard meetings and 1-on-1 coaching sessions             |

Each agent selects work via
[on-boot routing](.claude/agents/references/memory-protocol.md#on-boot-routing):
owned priorities → active claims → storyboard deliverables → domain checks →
cross-cutting fallback.

## Workflows

| Workflow            | Trigger                              | Agent(s)                                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **kata-shift**      | Daily 03:00 · 12:00 · 20:00 (Paris) | product-manager → staff-engineer → security-engineer → technical-writer → release-engineer → improvement-coach  |
| **kata-storyboard** | Daily 08:00 (Paris)                  | improvement-coach (facilitates 5 agents)                                                                        |
| **kata-coaching**   | `workflow_dispatch`                  | improvement-coach (facilitates 1 agent)                                                                         |
| **kata-dispatch**   | Events + bridge dispatch             | release-engineer (facilitates up to 4 agents)                                                                   |

**kata-shift** runs the roster sequentially (`max-parallel: 1`, `fail-fast:
false`). **kata-dispatch** is the event-driven counterpart — the release
engineer facilitates and routes to the best-suited agent. For bridge-dispatched
messages, `libeval` discuss mode enables multi-turn threaded conversations
spanning days via `Recess`/`Adjourn`. Concurrency group per artifact with
`cancel-in-progress: false`. All workflows support `workflow_dispatch` and
time out at 45 minutes.

## Skills

All Kata skills use the `kata-` prefix and own exactly one PDSA phase (or none
for utilities).

| Skill                     | Phase   | Purpose                                       |

## Shared Memory

Agents share persistent state via the **GitHub wiki** at `wiki/`, managed by
`libwiki` and the `fit-wiki` CLI. The wiki is a separate checkout (not a
submodule) — `wiki/` is gitignored, cloned on demand, synced by `just
wiki-pull` on session start and `just wiki-push` on stop.

Memory is the same regardless of which surface triggered the run. A
scheduled shift, a bridge-dispatched Discussion reply, and an IDE session all
read and write the same wiki files.

**Per-agent state:**
- **Summary** (`{agent}.md`) — current priorities, blockers, teammate observations.
- **Weekly log** (`{agent}-{YYYY}-W{VV}.md`) — append-only record, one file per
  agent per ISO week.

**Cross-agent state:**
- **MEMORY.md** — cross-cutting priorities and active claims (who is working on
  what target, branch, and PR).
- **STATUS.md** — canonical approval record for every spec (see § Approval
  Signal).
- **Storyboard** (`storyboard-{YYYY}-M{NN}.md`) — monthly storyboard with
  per-agent deliverables and experiment tracking.
- **Metrics** (`metrics/{skill}/{YYYY}.csv`) — per-skill run metrics.

The canonical read-summary, append-log, update-summary cadence is defined in
[memory-protocol.md](.claude/agents/references/memory-protocol.md). Read
contract: `Read wiki/MEMORY.md` + `Bash: fit-wiki boot`.

## Coordination

Four channels, governed by
[coordination-protocol.md](.claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md):

| Channel               | Use for                                          | Lifetime                              | Mechanism                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Storyboard**        | Daily current condition and next experiment      | One day; captured into wiki           | `kata-storyboard` workflow   |
| **Discussion**        | Open questions before they become decisions      | Open until resolved into spec or wiki | `ghbridge` → `kata-dispatch` |
| **PR / issue thread** | Real-time response on a specific artifact        | Lives with the artifact               | `kata-dispatch` workflow     |
| **Sub-agent**         | Specialized inline work within one run           | Ephemeral (one task)                  | `Agent` tool, skill spawning |

Discussions must terminate into a spec, wiki note, or close. PR/issue threads
are scoped to one artifact; cross-cutting questions belong in a Discussion.
Sub-agents don't carry state across runs — that's the wiki's job.

## Trust Boundary

The release engineer is the sole external merge point. The product manager
gates spec quality via PR-comment findings; trusted humans translate those
into `wiki/STATUS.md` writes that the release engineer reads at merge time.

```mermaid
graph TD
    EXT["External PR"] --> RE["Release Engineer<br/>trust + CI + STATUS gate"]
    ISS["External Issue"] --> PM["Product Manager<br/>spec quality findings"]
    PM -.->|"findings"| HU["Trusted Human<br/>writes STATUS"]
    HU -.->|"wiki/STATUS.md"| RE
    RE -- "merge fix/bug/spec" --> CB["Codebase (main)"]
    style RE fill:#a855f7,stroke:#7c3aed,color:#fff
    CB -- "approved spec" --> TA["Trusted Agents<br/>plan + implement"]
    TA --> CB
    SE["Security Engineer"] -- "Dependabot" --> CB
```

| External PR type | What merges                     | Who implements                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `fix` / `bug`    | Contributor's code (small)      | The external contributor              |
| `spec`           | Specification document only     | Trusted agents, never the contributor |
| Everything else  | Nothing — requires human review | N/A                                   |

Top-7 contributors pass the trust gate; `kata-agent-team` PRs are trusted by
identity.

## Approval Signal

Approval state is recorded in `wiki/STATUS.md` — a tab-separated file, one
row per spec: `{id}\t{phase}\t{status}`. STATUS is the canonical record;
`kata-release-merge` reads it to decide which phase PRs may merge.

| Signal | Source | Captured by |
|---|---|---|
| `<phase>:approved` label | Human or `/ship-it` | `kata-dispatch` |
| APPROVED review | Trusted-account approver | `kata-dispatch` |
| Approval comment ("LGTM", "ship it") | Trusted contributor | `kata-dispatch` |
| In-session user message | Trusted user | Active agent |
| `kata-plan` panel-clean | `staff-engineer` (plans only) | `kata-plan` skill |

Agents never autonomously originate `spec approved` or `design approved` —
they only propagate signals from trusted humans. Plans may be approved by
`staff-engineer` after `kata-plan` review. See
[approval-signals.md](.claude/agents/references/approval-signals.md).

## Metrics

End-to-end skills record per-run counts as CSV rows in
`wiki/metrics/{skill}/{YYYY}.csv`. Two classes: `process-throughput` (units
produced) and `system-health` (loop events observed). The storyboard reads
these via `fit-xmr` for control limits. Changes follow [coordination-protocol.md
§ Measurement-system changes](.claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md#measurement-system-changes).

## Design Principles

- **Simplicity over machinery.** Fewer moving parts, fewer failure modes, easier
  to audit.
- **PDSA over pipeline.** Findings from Study always re-enter the loop.
- **Fix-or-spec discipline.** Mechanical fixes and structural improvements never
  share a PR.
- **Explicit scope constraints.** Each agent knows what it must _not_ do.
- **Trace-driven accountability.** Every run captures a trace; the improvement
  coach quotes specific evidence. Use `fit-trace` to query.
- **Least privilege.** The workflow-level `permissions:` block restricts only
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The App token carries coordination-channel permissions via
  installation settings.
- **Surface-agnostic agents.** The same profiles and skills operate identically
  whether triggered by cron, a GitHub event, or a bridge-relayed message.
- **App-based auth.** GitHub App `kata-agent-team` with 1-hour installation
  tokens (no PAT). See [`github-app.md`](.claude/skills/kata-setup/references/github-app.md).
- **Main branch CI repair.** See CONTRIBUTING.md for the release engineer's
  direct-to-`main` exception.
- **Authoring.** Instruction architecture, length limits, skill structure, and
  the seven-layer model live in [COALIGNED.md](COALIGNED.md).
