# Forward Impact Engineering

> "The aim of leadership should be to improve the performance of man and
> machine, to improve quality, to increase output, and simultaneously to bring
> pride of workmanship to people."

## The Problem

Organizations force AI adoption onto engineers without regard for well-being,
quality of their output, or sustainability—creating disharmony between
leadership, engineers, and the AI strategy. What's missing is a human-centered
approach where AI empowers people to do their best work.

## The Vision

**Pathway** defines skills, behaviours, and career paths for human engineers and
AI coding agents alike. **Basecamp** gives every engineer a personal knowledge
system, powered by AI agents. Together, they raise quality, increase output, and
bring pride of workmanship to engineering teams.

## Products

**[Pathway](products/pathway)** — Web app and CLI for career progression. Browse
skills, generate job definitions, create agent team profiles.

**[Basecamp](products/basecamp)** — Personal knowledge system with scheduled AI
tasks. Sync email, prep meetings, draft responses.

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/forwardimpact/pathway.git
cd pathway
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to explore.
