# Forward Impact Engineering

> "The aim of leadership should be to improve the performance of man and

## The Problem

Organizations force AI adoption onto engineers without regard for well-being,
quality of their output, or sustainability—creating disharmony between
leadership, engineers, and the AI strategy. What's missing is a human-centered
approach where AI empowers people to do their best work.

## The Vision

Five products raise quality, increase output, and bring pride of workmanship to
engineering teams:

| Product      | Question it answers                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Map**      | What does good engineering look like here?      |
| **Pathway**  | Where should I grow next?                       |
| **Basecamp** | What do I need to handle today?                 |
| **Landmark** | What does my engineering work demonstrate?      |
| **Summit**   | Can this team deliver what we need?             |

## Products

**[Map](products/map)** — Data model, schema, and validation. Defines skills,
levels, behaviours, markers, and drivers in YAML. Single source of truth for the
career framework.

**[Pathway](products/pathway)** — Web app and CLI for career progression. Browse
skills, generate job definitions, create agent team profiles.

**[Basecamp](products/basecamp)** — Personal knowledge system with scheduled AI
tasks. Sync email, prep meetings, draft responses.

**[Guide](products/guide)** — LLM agent that interprets engineering artifacts
against skill markers. Reads source from Map, writes evidence back to Map.

**Landmark** — Thin analysis layer on Map data. Presents Guide-generated
evidence, GetDX snapshot scores, and trend views. No LLM calls — query,
aggregate, explain.

**Summit** — Team capability planning from skill data. Aggregates individual
skill matrices into coverage heatmaps, structural risk analysis, and what-if
staffing scenarios. Fully local and deterministic.

## Quick Start
