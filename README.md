# Forward Impact Engineering

> "The aim of leadership should be to improve the performance of man and
> machine, to improve quality, to increase output, and simultaneously to bring

## The Problem

Organizations force AI adoption onto engineers without regard for well-being,
quality of their output, or sustainability—creating disharmony between
leadership, engineers, and the AI strategy. What's missing is a human-centered
approach where AI empowers people to do their best work.

## The Vision

Six products raise quality, increase output, and bring pride of workmanship to
engineering teams:

| Product      | Question it answers                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Map**      | What does good engineering look like here?      |
| **Pathway**  | Where does my career path go from here?         |
| **Basecamp** | Am I prepared for what's ahead today?           |
| **Guide**    | How do I find my bearing?                       |
| **Landmark** | What milestones has my engineering reached?     |
| **Summit**   | Is this team supported to reach peak performance? |

## Products

**[Map](products/map)** — Data product for engineering capability. Defines
skills, levels, behaviours, markers, and drivers in YAML. Owned, validated, and
published for consumption by humans and agents.

**[Pathway](products/pathway)** — Web app and CLI for career progression. Browse
skills, generate job definitions, and create agent teams and skills to support
and empower the engineers.

**[Basecamp](products/basecamp)** — Personal knowledge system with scheduled AI
tasks. Sync email, prep meetings, draft responses.

**[Guide](products/guide)** — AI agent that understands your organization's
engineering framework. Helps engineers onboard, find growth areas, and interpret
artifacts against skill markers.

**Landmark** — Thin analysis layer on Map data. Presents Guide-generated
evidence, GetDX snapshot scores, and trend views. No LLM calls — query,
aggregate, explain.

**Summit** — Views a team as a system, not a collection of individuals.
Aggregates skill matrices into capability coverage, structural risks, and
what-if staffing scenarios. Fully local and deterministic.
