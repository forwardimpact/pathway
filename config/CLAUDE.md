# Config

Local runtime configuration. This directory is gitignored — each contributor
maintains their own `config.json`. The file is read by `libconfig` at startup.

## `config.json` structure

Three top-level sections, each consumed by a different factory in `libconfig`:

```json
{
  "init":    { ... },
  "service": { ... },
  "product": { ... }
}
```

### `init` — service supervision

Read by `createInitConfig()` → consumed by `fit-rc`. Defines which processes
the supervisor manages.

```json
{
  "init": {
    "log_dir": "data/logs",
    "shutdown_timeout": 3000,
    "services": [
      { "name": "graph",     "command": "node -e \"import('@forwardimpact/svcgraph/server.js')\"" },
      { "name": "pathway",   "command": "node -e \"import('@forwardimpact/svcpathway/server.js')\"" },
      { "name": "embedding", "command": "node -e \"import('@forwardimpact/svcembedding/server.js')\"" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each entry has a `name` and a `command` (the shell command `fit-rc` spawns).
Non-Node commands that need `.env` variables must source them explicitly (the
supervisor does not load `.env` — Node services use `libconfig` internally).

**Declaration order matters.** `fit-rc start <name>` starts from the named
service to the end of the list; `fit-rc stop <name>` stops from the named
service to the end (in reverse). `restart <name>` combines both — only the
named service and those declared after it are affected. Services declared
before the target are left untouched. List infrastructure (tunnels, databases)
before the services that depend on them so a service restart does not cycle
the tunnel.

Optional entries — add when working on those features:

```json
{ "name": "mstunnel", "command": "sh -c '. ./.env && exec cloudflared tunnel --url ${SERVICE_MSBRIDGE_URL} --protocol http2'" }
{ "name": "msbridge", "command": "node -e \"import('@forwardimpact/svcmsbridge/server.js')\"" }
```

Oneshot services use `"type": "oneshot"` with `up`/`down` instead of `command`.
`fit-rc start <name>` runs the `up` command; `fit-rc stop <name>` runs `down`:

```json
{
  "name": "supabase",
  "type": "oneshot",
  "up": "sh -c '. ./.env && cd products/map && supabase start --workdir .'",
  "down": "sh -c 'cd products/map && supabase stop --workdir .'"
}
```

### `service` — service configuration

Read by `createServiceConfig(name)`. Keyed by service name. Values are merged
with the service's constructor defaults, then overridden by `SERVICE_{NAME}_{KEY}`
environment variables from `.env` or the shell.

```json
{
  "service": {
    "mcp": {
      "systemPrompt": "...",
      "tools": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

### `product` — product configuration

Read by `createProductConfig(name)`. Same merge/override pattern as services,
with `PRODUCT_{NAME}_{KEY}` environment variables.

```json
{
  "product": {
    "guide": {
      "systemPrompt": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

## `.env`

Environment variables that configure services and products at runtime. Merge
order: constructor defaults → `config.json` → `.env`.

Credentials (API keys, tokens) are loaded into a private map and never set on
`process.env`; shell env wins at read time for credentials. All other keys are
set on `process.env` unconditionally from `.env` — the file is the persistent
source of truth, so editing `.env` and restarting the service always takes
effect.

See [services/CLAUDE.md](../services/CLAUDE.md) and
[products/CLAUDE.md](../products/CLAUDE.md) for conventions on each side.
See [libraries/CLAUDE.md](../libraries/CLAUDE.md) for the `libconfig`
implementation contract.
