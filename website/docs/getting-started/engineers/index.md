title: "Getting Started: Engineers"
description: "Browse career paths with Pathway, get AI guidance with Guide, check your evidence with Landmark, and set up your knowledge base with Basecamp."
---

Get up and running with the Forward Impact CLI tools. This guide covers browsing
your career framework, generating AI agent teams, getting framework-aware
guidance, checking your evidence and growth data, and managing your personal
knowledge base.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Install

```sh
npm install @forwardimpact/pathway @forwardimpact/guide @forwardimpact/landmark @forwardimpact/basecamp
```

This gives you four CLI tools:

- `fit-pathway` — browse job definitions and generate agent teams
- `fit-guide` — AI agent that understands your engineering framework
- `fit-landmark` — check your evidence, readiness, and growth timeline
- `fit-basecamp` — personal knowledge base with scheduled AI tasks

---

## Pathway

Pathway is your interface to the engineering framework. Browse job definitions,
explore career progression, and generate AI agent teams matched to your role.

### Initialize framework data

If your organization hasn't provided a framework data bundle, bootstrap starter
data to explore with:

```sh
npx fit-map init
```

This creates `./data/pathway/` with a complete starter framework. If your
organization distributes a framework bundle, follow their installation
instructions instead — typically a one-line `curl | bash` install script that
places data at `~/.fit/data/pathway/`.

#### Data directory resolution

The CLI resolves the data directory by walking upward from the current working
directory looking for a `data/pathway/` folder. To override, use the `--data`
flag:

```sh
npx fit-pathway discipline --list --data=./my-data/pathway
```

### Browse your job definition

Use the Pathway CLI to explore the engineering framework your organization has
defined.

```sh
npx fit-pathway discipline --list    # See available disciplines
npx fit-pathway level --list         # See available levels
npx fit-pathway track --list         # See available tracks
```

Generate a complete job definition by combining a discipline, level, and
optional track:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J040 --track=platform
```

This produces a full view of the skills, behaviours, and expectations for that
role.

### Generate agent teams

Create AI agent definitions matched to your role's skill profile:

```sh
npx fit-pathway agent software_engineering --track=platform --output=./agents
```

This generates a set of `.agent.md` files and a `skills/` directory. Each agent
file defines a persona with specific capabilities. The skills directory contains
`SKILL.md` files that agents use as operational context — the same skill
definitions humans reference, formatted for AI consumption.

Copy the output into your project's `.claude/` or equivalent agent configuration
directory.

## Guide

Guide is a conversational AI agent that understands your organization's
engineering framework. It helps you onboard, find growth areas, and interpret
engineering artifacts against your skill markers.

### Install and configure

```sh
npx fit-codegen --all    # provided by @forwardimpact/libcodegen (a dependency of guide)
npx fit-guide init
```

The `fit-codegen` step generates gRPC service clients that Guide needs. Without
it, imports fail with a missing module error.

The `init` step generates:

- `.env` — service secrets (`MCP_TOKEN`) and port assignments
- `config/config.json` — service startup configuration

### Configure credentials

Guide runs on the Anthropic API. Authenticate using one of:

```sh
npx fit-guide login       # OAuth PKCE flow (recommended)
```

Or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` manually. Guide validates credentials on
startup and reports if they are missing.

### Process data

Before starting the services, process the framework data into the indexes that
Guide's services read at runtime:

```sh
npx fit-process-resources # provided by @forwardimpact/libresource
npx fit-process-graphs    # provided by @forwardimpact/libgraph
```

These steps transform your `data/pathway/` into the resource index, knowledge
store, and graph index. Re-run them whenever you update framework data.

### Start the service stack

```sh
npx fit-rc start          # provided by @forwardimpact/librc
```

This supervises all required microservices (trace, vector, graph, llm, memory,
tool, agent, web) in dependency order. Configuration and secrets are read
automatically from `.env`. Stop them with `npx fit-rc stop`.

### Usage

```sh
npx fit-guide                                        # Start interactive conversation
echo "What skills should I focus on for L3?" | npx fit-guide  # Pipe a question
```

Example pipe-mode output:

```
L3 engineers in your organization focus on three skill areas:

**System Design** — Design components that interact with other teams'
services, make technology choices within your domain, and document
architectural decisions.

**Technical Leadership** — Lead small cross-functional projects, unblock
peers on technical decisions, and mentor junior engineers on best
practices.

**Operational Awareness** — Own reliability for your services, set up
monitoring and alerting, and participate in incident response rotations.

Based on your current profile, prioritize System Design and Technical
Leadership to close the gap to L3.
```

Guide reasons about your organization's specific skill definitions, behaviour
expectations, and markers — not generic career advice.

## Landmark

Landmark requires Map's activity layer (Supabase). If your organization has
already set this up, Landmark works immediately. If not, see the
[Landmark quickstart](/docs/guides/landmark-quickstart/) or the
[leadership getting-started](/docs/getting-started/leadership/) for activity
layer setup. One command works without Supabase: `marker` reads directly from
your framework YAML.

With the activity layer in place, Landmark gives you visibility into your own
practice evidence and growth data — showing what your engineering record looks
like against your framework's markers.

### Browse marker definitions

Look up the observable indicators defined for any skill — useful for
understanding what evidence is expected at each proficiency level:

```sh
npx fit-landmark marker task_completion
npx fit-landmark marker task_completion --level working
```

### Check your evidence

See which markers have evidence linked to your work:

```sh
npx fit-landmark evidence --email you@example.com
npx fit-landmark evidence --skill system_design --email you@example.com
```

Each row shows the artifact, the marker it matched, and Guide's rationale.
Filter by `--skill` to focus on a specific area.

### View your skill coverage

See how complete your evidence record is across all expected skills:

```sh
npx fit-landmark coverage --email you@example.com
```

Coverage shows evidenced artifacts versus total expected markers — a quick gauge
of where your record is strong and where it has gaps.

### Check promotion readiness

See which next-level markers you have already evidenced and which are still
outstanding:

```sh
npx fit-landmark readiness --email you@example.com
npx fit-landmark readiness --email you@example.com --target J060
```

Without `--target`, readiness checks against the next level above your current
level. With `--target`, you can check against any specific level — useful for
planning a multi-level trajectory.

### Track your growth timeline

See how your evidence has accumulated over time, aggregated by quarter:

```sh
npx fit-landmark timeline --email you@example.com
npx fit-landmark timeline --email you@example.com --skill system_design
```

Timelines help you see whether growth is accelerating, stalling, or concentrated
in one area. Add `--skill` to focus on a specific capability.

### Read your voice comments

See your own GetDX snapshot comments in a timeline view alongside evidence
context:

```sh
npx fit-landmark voice --email you@example.com
```

All Landmark commands support `--format text|json|markdown`.

## Basecamp

Basecamp is your personal operations center. It syncs email and calendar, builds
a knowledge graph, drafts responses, and prepares meeting briefings.

### Initialize a knowledge base

```sh
npx fit-basecamp init ~/Documents/Personal
```

### Check status

```sh
npx fit-basecamp status
```

### Run the scheduler

```sh
npx fit-basecamp daemon
```

Basecamp runs as a macOS status menu app with scheduled AI tasks handling
background work. The CLI scheduler works on any platform.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Guide: configuration errors on startup

Guide validates configuration before connecting. If you see errors about missing
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `MCP_TOKEN`, check that:

1. You ran `npx fit-guide init` (creates `.env` with `MCP_TOKEN`)
2. You ran `npx fit-guide login` or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`

### Guide: `Not authenticated` error

Run `npx fit-guide login` to authenticate with Anthropic, or set
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`.

### Guide: data not found

If Guide cannot answer questions, the knowledge indexes may not be populated.
Run the processing pipeline:

```sh
npx fit-process-resources
npx fit-process-graphs
```

Then restart the services.

### Guide: MCP endpoint unreachable

Verify the MCP service is running. Check `npx fit-guide status` for health
information, then restart the services:

```sh
npx fit-rc stop && npx fit-rc start
```

### Guide: missing module errors after install

Run code generation first — Guide depends on generated gRPC clients:

```sh
npx fit-codegen --all
```

### Guide: service startup failures

Check service logs for the failing service:

```sh
ls data/logs/          # List available service log directories
cat data/logs/llm/current   # View the LLM service log (example)
```

Each microservice writes to `data/logs/{service}/current`. Common causes are
missing environment variables or port conflicts.
