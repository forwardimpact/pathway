description: "Synthetic data pipeline — DSL parsing, entity generation, prose engine, rendering, and validation."
---

## Overview

`fit-universe` generates synthetic data for the entire Forward Impact suite from
a single DSL file. It produces career framework definitions, organizational
documents, developer activity records, and personal knowledge base content --
everything needed to develop, demo, or test the system without real data.

Generated output lands in `data/` at the monorepo root.

---

## Quick Start

```sh
# Generate structural data (no LLM needed)
bunx fit-universe

# Generate with LLM-written prose (requires LLM_TOKEN)
bunx fit-universe --generate

# Use cached prose for fast, repeatable runs
bunx fit-universe --cached

# Preview what would be generated
bunx fit-universe --dry-run

# Generate only pathway framework data
bunx fit-universe --only=pathway
```

---

## Pipeline Architecture

The generation pipeline follows five stages orchestrated by the `Pipeline` class
in `libraries/libuniverse/pipeline.js`:

```
parse -> generate -> prose -> render -> validate
```

1. **Parse** -- `DslParser` reads the DSL file and produces a structured
   universe definition
2. **Generate** -- `EntityGenerator` creates structural entities (people, teams,
   repos, skills) from the parsed definition using a seeded RNG for
   reproducibility
3. **Prose** -- `ProseEngine` and `PathwayGenerator` produce human-readable
   descriptions and framework prose via LLM calls (or cache)
4. **Render** -- `Renderer`, `ContentValidator`, and `ContentFormatter` produce
   final output files (YAML, HTML, Markdown, JSON)
5. **Validate** -- Cross-content validation checks referential integrity across
   all generated outputs

All collaborators are injected via constructor (OO+DI pattern). The composition
root in `bin/fit-universe.js` wires real implementations.

### Library Structure

Universe is split across three sub-libraries:

| Library              | Classes                                            | Purpose                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `libsyntheticgen`    | `DslParser`, `EntityGenerator`                     | Parsing and structural generation  |
| `libsyntheticprose`  | `ProseEngine`, `PathwayGenerator`                  | LLM prose and framework generation |
| `libsyntheticrender` | `Renderer`, `ContentValidator`, `ContentFormatter` | Output rendering and validation    |

The `libuniverse` package re-exports from all three and adds the `Pipeline`
orchestrator.

## Writing a Universe File

A universe file defines the shape of the synthetic world. The default lives at
`data/synthetic/story.dsl`.

```dsl
universe MyCompany {
  domain "mycompany.dev"
  industry "fintech"
  seed 42

  org hq {
    name "MyCompany Engineering"
    location "London, UK"
  }

  department engineering {
    name "Engineering"
    parent hq
    headcount 30

    team payments {
      name "Payments Team"
      size 8
      manager @alice
      repos ["payments-api", "billing-service"]
    }
  }

  people {
    count 30
    names "greek_mythology"
    distribution {
      L1 25%
      L2 30%
      L3 25%
      L4 15%
      L5 5%
    }
    disciplines {
      software_engineering 70%
      data_engineering 20%
      engineering_management 10%
    }
  }

  framework { ... }
  content guide_html { ... }
}
```

### Key Blocks

| Block        | Purpose                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `org`        | Top-level organization with name and location              |
| `department` | Organizational unit with headcount                         |
| `team`       | Team within a department, with manager and repos           |
| `people`     | People count, level distribution, discipline distribution  |
| `project`    | Cross-team initiative with timeline and prose topic        |
| `snapshots`  | GetDX snapshot generation (quarterly intervals)            |
| `scenario`   | Time-bounded effects on teams (commit volume, DX drivers)  |
| `framework`  | Pathway framework: levels, capabilities, disciplines, etc. |
| `content`    | Output content blocks (article counts, persona configs)    |

## What Gets Generated

### Framework data (`data/pathway/`)

Complete YAML files matching the Map schema -- levels, capabilities with skills,
disciplines, behaviours, tracks, stages, and drivers. These files are valid
input for `fit-pathway` and `fit-map validate`.

### Organizational documents (`data/organizational/`)

HTML articles, guides, FAQs, and course outlines for an internal engineering
knowledge base.

### Activity data (`data/activity/`)

Roster (organization people), GitHub events and artifacts, GetDX snapshots and
team scores, and skill evidence records.

### Personal content (`data/personal/`)

Markdown briefings and notes for Basecamp knowledge bases.

## Prose Modes

Content generation happens in tiers:

| Tier | What                           | Requires LLM |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 0    | Structural entities            | No           |
| 1    | Template-based prose           | Yes          |
| 2    | Deep framework prose (pathway) | Yes          |

Use `--generate` to invoke the LLM. Results are cached in
`data/synthetic/prose-cache.json` -- subsequent runs with `--cached` skip LLM
calls entirely. Use `--cached --strict` to fail on cache misses rather than
silently skipping.

---

## Validating Output

The CLI runs cross-content validation automatically after generation. To
validate the generated pathway data against the Map schema manually:

```sh
bunx fit-map validate --data=data/pathway
```

---

## Custom Story Files

Point to any DSL file with `--story=path`:

```sh
bunx fit-universe --story=./my-story.dsl --generate
```

This is useful for generating data for different organizational shapes, team
sizes, or framework configurations without modifying the default.
