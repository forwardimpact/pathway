## Goal

Improve the performance of engineers and agents, improve quality, increase
output, and bring pride of workmanship to engineering teams.

## Users

Three external user groups use the system. Every product serves at least two.
Internal contributors build and maintain the monorepo; external users consume
products via npm.

- **Leadership** — Define what good engineering looks like, staff teams to
  succeed, and measure outcomes without blaming individuals.
- **Engineers** — Understand expectations, find growth areas, stay prepared for
  daily work, and receive guidance grounded in their organization's framework.
- **Agents** — Operate with the same shared definitions, skill markers, and
  quality standards that humans use, so human–agent collaboration is coherent.

## Products

| Product      | Question it answers                               | Users                 | CLI            |

## Distribution Model

The monorepo is open source but external users never clone it. They consume
products exclusively via npm packages. The monorepo exists solely for internal
contributors.

### How External Users Consume Products

External users install products with `npm install`, bringing their own framework
data. All CLIs use `#!/usr/bin/env node` — no Bun required.

Products depending on `librpc` (currently Guide) need generated gRPC clients.
External users run `npx fit-codegen --all` after install.
`@forwardimpact/libcodegen` must be a dependency of any product needing
generated code. Without this step, imports fail with a missing
`generated/services/exports.js` error.

Published skills (`fit-*` in `.claude/skills/`) help external users understand
how products **work** — not how they are **implemented**. Synced to
`forwardimpact/skills` on push to `main`. External users install them with
`npx skills add forwardimpact/skills`.

### How Internal Contributors Develop

| Context               | Runtime  | Package manager | CLI commands         |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| External users        | Node.js  | npm             | `npx fit-*`          |
| Internal contributors | Bun 1.2+ | bun             | `bunx fit-*`, `just` |

`just codegen` (included in `just quickstart`) runs `fit-codegen` internally.
Internal skills (`libs-*`, product internals) help contributors understand
architecture — these are never published.

**Documentation rule:** External-facing docs must use `npm`/`npx`.
`bun`/`bunx`/`just` appear only in internal docs (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, operations
reference, internals pages).

## Documentation Map

Policy rows (†) have one canonical location — other files reference, never
restate.

## Contributor Workflow

Everything below this point is for internal contributors. External users should
consult the product READMEs or
[Getting Started guides](website/docs/getting-started/).

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — PR workflow, git conventions, quality
  commands, security policies. **Read before your first commit.**
- **[Operations Reference](website/docs/internals/operations/index.md)** —
  Environment setup, service management, common tasks.

Commit format: `type(scope): subject` — see CONTRIBUTING.md § Git Conventions.

Run `bun run check` before every commit — code **and** documentation.

## Structure

Plain JS + JSDoc, YAML, no frameworks.

```
products/
  map/          Data product, validation          (fit-map)
  pathway/      Web app, CLI, formatters          (fit-pathway)
  basecamp/     Knowledge system, scheduler       (fit-basecamp)
  guide/        LLM agent, artifact interpretation
  landmark/     Signal analysis on Map data       (fit-landmark)
  summit/       Team capability as a system        (fit-summit)
libraries/
  libskill/     Derivation logic, job/agent models
  libuniverse/  Synthetic data DSL and generation  (fit-universe)
  libui/        Web UI framework, components, CSS
  libdoc/       Documentation build/serve         (fit-doc)
services/
  agent/ graph/ llm/ memory/ tool/ trace/ vector/ web/
config/
  config.json   Service definitions, model settings, eval config
  tools.yml     Tool endpoint definitions
  agents/       Agent prompt files (*.agent.md)
specs/
  {feature}/    Feature specifications and plans
```

Data-driven: entities defined in YAML, each external installation may have
completely different framework data while using the same product code.

### Key Paths

| Purpose      | Location                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Pathway data | `data/pathway/`                    |
| JSON Schema  | `products/map/schema/json/`        |
| RDF/SHACL    | `products/map/schema/rdf/`         |
| Formatters   | `products/pathway/src/formatters/` |
| KB template  | `products/basecamp/template/`      |

## OO+DI Architecture

Every library and product follows a standard pattern:

- **Classes** accept collaborators through constructors
- **Factory functions** (`createXxx`) wire real implementations
- **Composition roots** (CLI `bin/` entry points) wire all instances
- **Tests** bypass factories and inject mocks directly

**Exceptions:** libskill (pure functions), libui (functional DOM), libsecret
(stateless crypto), libtype (generated protobuf). Pure stateless functions do
not need DI.

## Skill Groups

Library skills are organized into capability groups with corresponding skill
files in `.claude/skills/`.

| Group                         | Libraries                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `libs-service-infrastructure` | librpc, libconfig, libtelemetry, libtype, libharness              |
| `libs-data-persistence`       | libstorage, libindex, libresource, libpolicy, libgraph, libvector |
| `libs-llm-orchestration`      | libllm, libmemory, libprompt, libagent                            |
| `libs-web-presentation`       | libui, libformat, libweb, libdoc, libtemplate                     |
| `libs-system-utilities`       | libutil, libsecret, libsupervise, librc, libcodegen               |
| `libs-synthetic-data`         | libsyntheticgen, libsyntheticprose, libsyntheticrender            |

`libskill` retains its own skill (pure-function design, exempt from OO+DI).

## Domain Concepts

> Entities are defined in YAML under `data/pathway/`. Use
> `bunx fit-pathway <entity> --list` to discover available values.

| Entity       | File Location                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Disciplines  | `disciplines/{id}.yaml`            |
| Levels       | `levels.yaml`                      |
| Tracks       | `tracks/{id}.yaml`                 |
| Capabilities | `capabilities/{id}.yaml`           |
| Skills       | `capabilities/{id}.yaml` (skills:) |
| Behaviours   | `behaviours/{id}.yaml`             |
| Stages       | `stages.yaml`                      |
| Drivers      | `drivers.yaml`                     |

All entities use co-located `human:` and `agent:` sections.

- **Skill proficiencies**: awareness → foundational → working → practitioner →
  expert
- **Behaviour maturities**: emerging → developing → practicing → role_modeling →
  exemplifying
- **Disciplines** define role types with T-shaped skill tiers
  (core/supporting/broad)
- **Tracks** are pure modifiers — adjust expectations via `skillModifiers`
- **Capabilities** group skills, define responsibilities, provide stage handoffs
- **Stages** define lifecycle phases with constraints and checklists
- **Tools** derived from `toolReferences` at runtime via `bunx fit-pathway tool`

Validate data: `bunx fit-map validate`. Vocabulary standards in the
[Authoring Frameworks guide](website/docs/guides/authoring-frameworks/index.md).
