# Forward Impact Engineering

## Goal

> "The aim of leadership should be to improve the performance of [engineers] and
> [agents], to improve quality, to increase output, and simultaneously to bring
> pride of workmanship to people."
>
> — W. Edwards Deming

## Primary Products

Three external user groups hire these products. Internal contributors build and
maintain the monorepo; external users consume products via npm. See
[JTBD.md](JTBD.md) for the jobs each persona hires our products to do.

- **Engineering Leaders** — Define what good engineering looks like, staff teams
  to succeed, and measure outcomes without blaming individuals.
- **Empowered Engineers** — Understand expectations, find growth areas, prepare
  for the day ahead, and equip and trust their agent teams — grounded in their
  organization's agent-aligned engineering standard.
- **Teams Using Agents** — Run an autonomous, continuously improving development
  team that plans, ships, studies its own traces, and acts on findings.

### Map — `fit-map`

Hired by engineering leaders to turn 'good engineering' into an operational
definition the organization trusts. Catches structural mistakes before they
ship. [Overview](websites/fit/map/index.md) ·
[Internals](websites/fit/docs/internals/map/index.md)

### Pathway — `fit-pathway`

Hired by leaders to define roles, engineers to see what's expected, and agents to
be configured to match. Makes expectations visible and coherent across
evaluations. [Overview](websites/fit/pathway/index.md) ·
[Internals](websites/fit/docs/internals/pathway/index.md)

### Guide — `fit-guide`

Hired by engineers to get career guidance and output review grounded in their
organization's actual standard, not generic advice or subjective impressions.
[Overview](websites/fit/guide/index.md) ·
[Internals](websites/fit/docs/internals/guide/index.md)

### Landmark — `fit-landmark`

Hired by leaders to demonstrate engineering progress and by engineers to show
evidence of growth — both without making individuals feel surveilled.
[Overview](websites/fit/landmark/index.md) ·
[Internals](websites/fit/docs/internals/landmark/index.md)

### Summit — `fit-summit`

Hired by engineering leaders to replace staffing guesswork with evidence-based
team composition analysis. Surfaces capability gaps before someone gets set up to
fail. [Overview](websites/fit/summit/index.md) ·
[Internals](websites/fit/docs/internals/summit/index.md)

### Outpost — `fit-outpost`

Hired by engineers to maintain continuous awareness of people, projects, and
threads without continuous effort. Assembles context so they walk into every
meeting already oriented. [Overview](websites/fit/outpost/index.md) ·
[Internals](websites/fit/docs/internals/outpost/index.md)

### Kata — `kata-skills`

Hired by teams using agents to run an autonomous development team that keeps
getting better. Organized as a daily Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle where agents plan by
writing specs, ship features, study their own traces, and act on findings.
[Internals](websites/fit/docs/internals/kata/)

## Secondary Products

**Platform Builders** hire these products to _construct agent-capable systems
using shared libraries and services designed for humans and agents alike._
[Libraries § Jobs To Be Done](libraries/README.md#jobs-to-be-done) ·
[Services § Jobs To Be Done](services/README.md#jobs-to-be-done)

### Gear — `fit-skills`

Hired by platform builders to give humans and agents shared capabilities through
the same interface, with tooling to prove changes actually improved outcomes.

[Libraries § Catalog](libraries/README.md#catalog) ·
[Services § Catalog](services/README.md#catalog)

## Distribution Model

The monorepo is open source but external users never clone it. They consume
products exclusively via npm packages. The monorepo exists solely for internal
contributors.

### How External Users Consume Products

Agents are often the primary consumers. Published skills teach how a product
**works** and **uses** — not how it is implemented. Use fully qualified URLs
(e.g.
`https://www.forwardimpact.team/docs/products/authoring-standards/index.md`).

Two skill packs sync on push to `main`: `forwardimpact/fit-skills` (the `fit-*`
product and library skills) and `forwardimpact/kata-skills` (the `kata-*`
agent-team skills). Install: `npx skills add forwardimpact/fit-skills` (or
`kata-skills`). All CLIs use `#!/usr/bin/env node` — no Bun required. gRPC
products (currently Guide) need `npx fit-codegen --all`. See
[Codegen Internals](websites/fit/docs/internals/codegen/index.md).

### How Internal Contributors Develop

- **External users** — Node.js + npm, run `npx fit-*`.
- **Internal contributors** — Bun 1.2+ + bun, run `bunx fit-*` and `just`.

`just codegen` (included in `just quickstart`) runs `fit-codegen` internally.
Internal skills (`libs-*`, product internals) are never published. External docs
use `npm`/`npx`; `bun`/`bunx`/`just` appear only in internal docs.

## Contributor Workflow

Everything below this point is for internal contributors. External users should
consult the [Getting Started guides](websites/fit/docs/getting-started/).

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — Invariants, structure, quality
  commands, security policies. **Read before your first commit.**
- **[Operations Reference](websites/fit/docs/internals/operations/index.md)** —
  Environment setup, service management, common tasks.

### Jobs and Checklists

Tagged jobs capture the progress each user hires a product to make. Tagged
checklists gate pause points. Discover both with `rg`:

```sh
rg '<job '                  # Jobs with Big Hires and Little Hires
rg '<read_do_checklist'     # Entry gates — read each item, then do it
rg '<do_confirm_checklist'  # Exit gates — do from memory, then confirm
```

**Every contribution** runs [§ READ-DO](CONTRIBUTING.md#read-do) then
[§ DO-CONFIRM](CONTRIBUTING.md#do-confirm). Domain checklists in
`.claude/skills/kata-*/SKILL.md`. Shared libraries:
[libraries/README.md](libraries/README.md).

## Memory and Coordination

Wiki is **memory** — own state (summaries, logs, metrics), not a handoff
channel. **Coordination** requires a named receiver and addressable artifact:
Issue, PR/issue comment, Discussion, or `agent-react`. See
[memory-protocol](.claude/agents/references/memory-protocol.md) and
[coordination-protocol](.claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md).

## Domain Concepts

Agent-aligned engineering standards are defined in YAML under
[products/map/starter/](products/map/starter/) (the monorepo's starter template,
which installs to `data/pathway/` in consuming projects). Use
`bunx fit-pathway <entity> --list` to discover available values.

- **Disciplines** — `disciplines/{id}.yaml`
- **Levels** — `levels.yaml`
- **Tracks** — `tracks/{id}.yaml`
- **Capabilities** & **Skills** — `capabilities/{id}.yaml` (skills nested)
- **Behaviours** — `behaviours/{id}.yaml`
- **Drivers** — `drivers.yaml`

Validate data: `bunx fit-map validate`. Vocabulary standards in the
[Authoring Agent-Aligned Engineering Standards guide](websites/fit/docs/products/authoring-standards/index.md).
