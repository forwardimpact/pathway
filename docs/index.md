## Get Started

### For organizations

Publish a career framework for your engineering team:

```sh
npx fit-pathway build --url=https://pathway.myorg.com
```

### For engineers

Install the CLI and explore what's available:

```sh
npx fit-pathway skill --list        # Browse all skills
npx fit-pathway job se L3            # Generate a job definition
npx fit-pathway agent se --track=dx  # Generate agent profiles
```

### For personal productivity

Set up Basecamp and let scheduled AI tasks keep you organized:

```sh
npx fit-basecamp --init ~/Documents/Team
npx fit-basecamp --daemon
```
