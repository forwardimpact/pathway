      Forward Impact Team puts this into practice. Organizations define what great engineering looks like — skills, behaviours, and career levels — in a shared framework. Engineers gain clear expectations, career paths, AI assistance, and knowledge systems matched to their standards. When the path forward is clear, engineers deliver with confidence and pride.

## Get Started

### For organizations

Define and publish an engineering career framework for your team:

```sh
npx fit-pathway build --url=https://pathway.myorg.com
```

### For engineers

Install the CLI and explore what's available:

```sh
npx fit-pathway skill --list        # Browse all skills
npx fit-pathway job se L3            # Generate a job definition
npx fit-pathway agent se --track=dx  # Generate agent profiles
```

### For personal productivity

Set up Basecamp and let scheduled AI tasks keep you organized:

```sh
npx fit-basecamp --init ~/Documents/Team
npx fit-basecamp --daemon
```
