### Map

Chart the territory. Define your engineering skills, behaviours, and career
levels in plain YAML — the single source of truth.

#### One Source of Truth

Skills, behaviours, and levels defined once in YAML — used everywhere, by humans
and machines alike.

</div>

<div>

#### Human + Machine

Career frameworks and AI agent profiles derived from the same foundation.
Co-located in the same files.

</div>

<div>

#### Data-Driven

Plain YAML files. No vendor lock-in. Your data, your way. Different
installations use the same model.

</div>

<div>

#### Ready to Deploy

Works at the command line, in VS Code, and on the web — meeting engineers where
they already work.

Forward Impact Team puts this into practice. Organizations define what great
engineering looks like — skills, behaviours, and career levels — in a shared
framework. Engineers gain clear expectations, career paths, AI assistance, and
knowledge systems matched to their standards. When the path forward is clear,
engineers deliver with confidence and pride.

## Get Started

### For organizations

Define and publish an engineering career framework for your team:

```sh
npx fit-pathway build --url=https://pathway.myorg.com
```

### For engineers

Install the CLI and explore what's available:

```sh
npx fit-pathway skill --list        # Browse all skills
npx fit-pathway job se L3            # Generate a job definition
npx fit-pathway agent se --track=dx  # Generate agent profiles
```

### For personal productivity

Set up Basecamp and let scheduled AI tasks keep you organized:

```sh
npx fit-basecamp --init ~/Documents/Team
npx fit-basecamp --daemon
```
