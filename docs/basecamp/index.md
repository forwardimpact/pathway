> Everything you and your team know, in one place. Basecamp is a scheduler that
> runs Claude Code tasks on a timer — syncing data, extracting entities,
> drafting emails, preparing for meetings. No server, no database — just plain
> files, markdown, and Claude. Your knowledge base is Obsidian-compatible, your
> config is JSON, and everything is transparent.

### Who it's for

**Busy engineers and managers** who want an AI assistant that actually knows
their context — who they work with, what projects are active, and what's coming
up next.

**Anyone on macOS** who wants a set-and-forget knowledge system that runs
quietly in the background and keeps getting smarter about your work.
