> "The aim of leadership should be to improve the performance of man and
> machine, to improve quality, to increase output, and simultaneously to bring
> pride of workmanship to people." **— W. Edwards Deming**

This quote has guided how we think about engineering organizations. Too often,
the conversation about engineering productivity focuses on measuring output —
story points, lines of code, deployment frequency. These metrics have their
place, but they miss the point. The real question isn't "how much are engineers
producing?" It's "are we empowering engineers to have lasting impact on our
business and customers?"

## The Problem With Frameworks

Most career frameworks are written once, filed away, and never referenced again.
They describe levels in vague terms — "demonstrates leadership" or "has broad
impact" — that mean different things to different people. Engineers can't use
them to grow. Managers can't use them to set clear expectations. And nobody can
use them to tell an AI agent how the team actually works.

We think career frameworks should be living systems. They should be precise
enough that a machine can validate them, but readable enough that an engineer
can understand what's expected at any level. They should produce real outputs —
job descriptions, agent profiles, interview questions, progression plans — not
just sit in a wiki.

## The Idea

Forward Impact Team starts from a simple premise: **if you define what great
engineering looks like, you can derive everything else from it.**

Define your skills, behaviours, and career levels in plain YAML files. From that
single source of truth, the system produces:

- **Job definitions** that combine discipline, track, and level into clear role
  expectations
- **AI agent profiles** that match your engineering standards, scoped to
  specific lifecycle stages
- **Interview questions** grounded in the actual skills you care about
- **Progression plans** that show engineers exactly what changes between levels
- **Knowledge systems** that keep engineers briefed and organized

The framework isn't a bureaucratic exercise. It's infrastructure — the same way
a CI pipeline is infrastructure. Once it's in place, everyone benefits from it
continuously.

## People, Not Process

Deming's insight is that quality comes from systems, not from inspecting
individuals. When the system is right — when expectations are clear, tools are
good, and people understand their path — quality follows naturally.

That's the design principle behind every product in the suite:

**Map** gives organizations a way to articulate what "good" looks like — not in
vague terms, but in structured, validatable definitions that everyone can
reference.

**Pathway** turns those definitions into things engineers actually use: career
browsers, job descriptions, AI agents that follow team standards, and
progression plans that make growth tangible.

**Guide** will connect these systems into context-aware AI assistance —
onboarding, career advice, and problem-solving grounded in the team's actual
framework, not generic best practices.

**Basecamp** gives engineers a personal operations center — scheduled AI tasks
that sync information, prepare briefings, and organize knowledge so engineers
can focus on the work that matters.

Together, these products don't monitor or measure engineers. They equip them.
Clear expectations, visible career paths, intelligent assistance, and organized
knowledge — the conditions under which people do their best work.

## Open Source, Real World

The entire suite is open source. The data model is yours — defined in YAML,
validated by schema, stored in your repository. Different organizations use the
same model with completely different data. There's no vendor lock-in, no
proprietary format, no SaaS dependency.

The tools are built with vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks, and designed to be
simple rather than easy. Every design choice favours reducing complexity over
hiding it.

## Who We Are

Forward Impact Team is built and maintained by the Developer Experience team at
a large pharmaceutical company. We work in an industry where technology serves a
purpose beyond itself — where the software we build, the platforms we maintain,
and the engineers we support contribute to outcomes that matter for patients'
lives.

We built FIT because we believe the best way to have lasting positive impact is
to empower the people doing the work. When engineers have clear expectations,
visible growth paths, and tools that respect their craft, they deliver better
software — and better software means better outcomes for the people who depend
on it.
