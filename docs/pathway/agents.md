## Agent Skills Standard (SKILL.md)

Agent skills follow the [Agent Skills Standard](https://agentskills.io/), an
open format that enables portability across different AI agents including GitHub
Copilot, VS Code, and CLI tools.

Each skill generates a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
# .github/skills/code-quality-review/SKILL.md
---
name: code-quality-review
description: |
  Guide for reviewing code quality. Use when reviewing PRs,
  conducting code reviews, or assessing code health.
---

# Code Quality & Review

## When to use this skill
- Reviewing pull requests
- Assessing code health
- Establishing quality standards

## Project-Specific Guidance
...detailed instructions, examples, and references...
```

Key benefits:

- **Portable**: Works across VS Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and coding agents
- **Progressive loading**: Only relevant skills load into context
- **Resource inclusion**: Skills can reference scripts, templates, and examples
- **Composable**: Multiple skills combine for complex workflows

### Skill Body Guidelines

| Include                    | Exclude                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Project-specific patterns  | Generic best practices       |
| Codebase conventions       | Language documentation       |
| Local file references      | External tutorials           |
| Team preferences           | Universal programming advice |
| Integration patterns       | Tool installation guides     |
| Testing strategies (local) | Widely-known frameworks      |

The agent already knows general programming. Focus on what makes THIS codebase
unique.

## Agent Profile Derivation

Agent profiles combine Discipline, Track, and Stage to produce stage-specific
[VS Code Custom Agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph inputs["Inputs"]
        D["Discipline<br>coreInstructions<br>constraints"]
        T["Track<br>coreInstructions<br>roleContext<br>constraints"]
        S["Stage<br>tools<br>handoffs<br>constraints"]
    end

    subgraph derive["Derivation"]
        skills["Derive skills<br>(exclude isHumanOnly)"]
        behaviours["Derive behaviours"]
        tools["Use stage tools"]
        checklists["Generate checklists"]
    end

    subgraph output["Output"]
        agent[".agent.md file"]
    end

    D --> derive
    T --> derive
    S --> derive

    derive --> agent
```

### Reference Grade

Agent profiles use a dynamically derived reference grade based on your
configured grades. The system selects the first grade where primary skills reach
**practitioner** level, providing a balanced skill profile that represents
substantive senior-level expertise.

If no practitioner-level grade exists, it falls back to the first working-level
grade, or the middle grade if neither exists.

### Human-Only Skills

Skills marked `isHumanOnly: true` require physical presence, emotional
intelligence, or relationship building. These are excluded from agent profile
derivation but remain fully defined for human roles.

---

## Stage-Specific Agents

Each stage produces a separate agent with appropriate tools and constraints. See
[Lifecycle](../model/lifecycle.md) for stage definitions.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    specify["Specify Agent\n(read-only)"]
    plan["Plan Agent\n(read-only)"]
    code["Code Agent\n(full access)"]
    review["Review Agent\n(read-only)"]
    deploy["Deploy Agent\n(read-only)"]

    specify -->|"Create Plan"| plan
    plan -->|"Start Coding"| code
    code -->|"Request Review"| review
    review -->|"Deploy"| deploy
    review -->|"Request Changes"| code
    review -->|"Needs Replanning"| plan
```

### Stage Tool Sets

| Stage   | Tools                                  | Mode        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Specify | search, fetch, codebase, read          | Read-only   |
| Plan    | search, fetch, codebase, read          | Read-only   |
| Code    | search, codebase, read, edit, terminal | Full access |
| Review  | search, codebase, read                 | Read-only   |
| Deploy  | terminal, codebase, read               | Read-only   |

### Tool Derivation

Stages define the authoritative tool set for each lifecycle phase:

```
Final Tools = Stage.tools
```

## Generated Agent Profile

Each `.agent.md` file follows this structure:

```yaml
---
name: software-engineering-platform-plan
description: |
  Planning agent for Software Engineering on Platform track.
  Use for research, context gathering, and plan generation.
tools: [search, fetch, codebase]
infer: true
handoffs:
  - label: Start Coding
    agent: software-engineering-platform-code
    prompt: Implement the planned changes.
---

# Software Engineering - Platform - Plan Agent

You are in planning mode. Research, gather context, and generate
implementation plans without making code changes.

## Core Identity

{Track.agent.coreInstructions or Discipline.agent.coreInstructions with template substitution}

Your primary capabilities:
- Architecture & Design
- Code Quality & Review
- Cloud Platforms
- DevOps & CI/CD

## Operational Context

{Track.roleContext}

## Working Style

{Top 3 behaviours with workflow patterns}

## Before Handoff

Before offering a handoff, verify and summarize completion of these items:

{Derived from Handoff × Skills Matrix × Capability Checklists}

When verified, summarize what was accomplished then offer the handoff.
If items are incomplete, explain what remains.

## Return Format

When completing work (for handoff or as a subagent), provide:

1. **Work completed**: What was accomplished
2. **Checklist status**: Items verified from Before Handoff section
3. **Recommendation**: Ready for next stage, or needs more work

## Constraints

- Do not make code edits
- {Discipline.agent.constraints}
- {Track.agent.constraints}
```

---

## Handoff Flow

Agents form a connected workflow through VS Code's handoff system. Handoff
buttons appear after each response, allowing transitions between stage agents.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    specify["Specify Agent"]
    plan["Plan Agent"]
    code["Code Agent"]
    review["Review Agent"]
    deploy["Deploy Agent"]

    specify -->|"Create Plan"| plan
    plan -->|"Start Coding"| code
    code -->|"Request Review"| review
    review -->|"Deploy"| deploy
    review -->|"Request Changes"| code
    deploy -->|"Plan Next Work"| specify
```

Humans guide AI through the lifecycle with explicit approval at each transition,
maintaining control over when stages change.
