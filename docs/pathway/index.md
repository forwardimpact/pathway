> Pathway is your interface to the engineering framework. Feed it a discipline,
> a track, and a grade — and it produces a complete job definition. Swap the
> grade for a lifecycle stage and you get an agent profile instead. Same data,
> same formula, different outputs.

### What you get

- An interactive web app to explore roles, skills, and career paths
- A CLI for generating job descriptions and agent profiles
- VS Code Custom Agent profiles derived from your framework
- Agent skill files following the open Agent Skills Standard
- A static site export for publishing your career framework
- Interview question sets tailored to each role

### Who it's for

**Engineers** who want to understand where they are and where they're heading.
Browse skills, explore what's expected at the next grade, and identify growth
areas.

**Managers** building job descriptions. Select a discipline, track, and grade —
Pathway generates a complete, consistent job definition.

**Teams adopting AI agents.** Generate VS Code agent profiles and skill files
that match your engineering standards, constrained by lifecycle stage.
