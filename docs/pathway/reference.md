The `_index.yaml` files are auto-generated by `npx pathway --generate-index` and
list all entity files in each directory. These enable browser-based loading
without filesystem access. Run `npm start` to regenerate them automatically.

## Co-located File Structure

All entity files (behaviours, disciplines, tracks) contain both human and agent
definitions in the same file. Skills are embedded within capability files.

### Capability File (with embedded skills)

Skills are defined within capability files, grouped with related checklists and
responsibilities:
