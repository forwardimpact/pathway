The Guide doesn't carry you — it shows you which way to go. Powered by the
same skills framework that defines your career path, Guide provides
context-aware AI assistance that understands your engineering organization.
It helps new engineers onboard, existing engineers grow, and teams orient
around shared expectations.

### The Vision

Guide operates at the intersection of three knowledge sources:

1. **Your skills framework** — the Map data that defines what "good" looks like
2. **Your team context** — conventions, patterns, and preferences
3. **The engineer's profile** — where they are and where they want to go

By combining these, Guide provides advice that's specific to your organization
rather than generic best practices.

### Stay Updated

Guide is currently in development. The foundation is being built in the Map,
Pathway, and Basecamp products. When these are mature, Guide will connect them
into a unified AI experience for engineering teams.
