> The Guide doesn't carry you — it shows you which way to go. Powered by the
> same skills framework that defines your career path, Guide provides
> context-aware AI assistance that understands your engineering organization. It
> helps new engineers onboard, existing engineers grow, and teams orient around
> shared expectations.

### What Guide will offer

- AI-powered onboarding that understands your team's skill framework
- Career advice grounded in your organization's actual grade expectations
- Contextual help that references the right skills and behaviours
- Problem-solving assistance that knows your team's conventions
- Growth recommendations based on gap analysis between current and target roles

### The Vision

Guide operates at the intersection of three knowledge sources:

1. **Your skills framework** — the Map data that defines what "good" looks like
2. **Your team context** — conventions, patterns, and preferences
3. **The engineer's profile** — where they are and where they want to go

By combining these, Guide provides advice that's specific to your organization
rather than generic best practices.

### Stay Updated

Guide is currently in development. The foundation is being built in the Map,
Pathway, and Basecamp products. When these are mature, Guide will connect them
into a unified AI experience for engineering teams.
