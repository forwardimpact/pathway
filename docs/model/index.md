## Chart the Route

</div>

<div class="product-value">
<p>
The Model is the derivation engine at the heart of Forward Impact. Feed it a
discipline, a track, and a grade — and it produces a complete job definition.
Swap the grade for a lifecycle stage and you get an agent profile instead. Same
data, same formula, different outputs.
</p>
</div>

### What you get

<ul class="benefits">
<li>Job definitions derived from Discipline × Track × Grade</li>
<li>Agent profiles derived from Discipline × Track × Stage</li>
<li>Skill matrices with automatically applied track modifiers</li>
<li>Behaviour profiles calibrated to career level</li>
<li>Stage-transition checklists tailored to each role</li>
<li>Career progression analysis showing the path ahead</li>
</ul>

### Who it's for

**Engineering managers** building job descriptions that are consistent,
comparable, and connected to real skill expectations.

**Platform teams** generating coding agent profiles that match the same
standards as human engineers.

**HR and talent teams** who want structured, data-driven career frameworks
instead of ad-hoc job descriptions.

## The Core Formula

Every output traces back to a simple combination:

```
Job    = Discipline × Track × Grade
Agent  = Discipline × Track × Stage
```

| Input          | Question                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Discipline** | What kind of engineer?      |
| **Track**      | Where and how do you work?  |
| **Grade**      | What career level?          |
| **Stage**      | What part of the lifecycle? |

Both jobs and agents use the same skill and behaviour derivation. The difference:
jobs include all skills capped by grade, while agents filter out human-only
skills and constrain by lifecycle stage.

## Key Capabilities

| Capability          | What it does                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Job derivation**  | Complete role definitions with skills and behaviours |
| **Agent profiles**  | Stage-specific agent instructions for AI assistants  |
| **Skill matrices**  | Derived skill levels with track modifiers applied    |
| **Checklists**      | Stage transition criteria from capability definitions|
| **Progression**     | Career path analysis and gap identification          |
| **Interviews**      | Role-specific question selection                     |
| **Job matching**    | Gap analysis between current and target roles        |
