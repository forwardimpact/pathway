title: Map
description: Data model, storage contracts, validation, and ingestion surfaces for Map.
---

## Overview

Map is the central data store of the FIT suite. It defines framework entities
in YAML and stores operational activity data used by downstream products.

> See the [Map product page](/map/) for a high-level overview.

---

## Position in the Suite

Map provides two domains:

1. **Framework domain** — skills, behaviours, levels, disciplines, tracks,
	stages, drivers, and interview questions.
2. **Activity domain** — organization hierarchy, GitHub activity/evidence, and
	GetDX snapshot aggregates.

Products query Map through shared contracts across these datasets.

## How Data is Organized

### Framework definitions (YAML)

Definitions live in YAML files under your data directory:

```
data/
├── levels.yaml           # Career levels (L1–L5)
├── stages.yaml           # Engineering lifecycle phases
├── drivers.yaml          # Organizational outcomes
├── disciplines/          # Engineering specialties
├── tracks/               # Work context modifiers
├── behaviours/           # Approaches to work
├── capabilities/         # Skill groups with responsibilities
└── questions/            # Interview questions
```

### Activity model (stored records)

Core activity contracts:

- `organization_people` — flat people list with manager references
- team scope derived from manager hierarchy
- `github_events`, `github_artifacts`, `evidence`
- `getdx_teams`, `getdx_snapshots`, `getdx_snapshot_team_scores`

---

## Validation

Map validates referential integrity, required fields, valid enum values, and
cross-entity consistency:

```sh
npx fit-map validate          # Full validation
npx fit-map validate --shacl  # RDF/SHACL validation
npx fit-map generate-index    # Generate browser indexes
```

Validation covers framework definitions. Activity ingestion validation is handled
by ingestion pipelines and table constraints.

---

## Programmatic Access

```javascript
import { loadAllData } from "@forwardimpact/map";
import { validateAll } from "@forwardimpact/map/validation";
import { SKILL_PROFICIENCIES, BEHAVIOUR_MATURITIES } from "@forwardimpact/map/levels";

const data = await loadAllData("./data");
```

For activity datasets, consumers query Map storage APIs/views rather than local
YAML loaders.

---

## Schema Formats

Definitions are available in two schema formats, always kept in sync:

| Format          | Path           | Purpose                      |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **JSON Schema** | `schema/json/` | YAML validation tooling      |
| **RDF/SHACL**   | `schema/rdf/`  | Linked data interoperability |

---

## Entity Types

| Entity           | Question                  | File Location                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Disciplines**  | What kind of engineer?    | `disciplines/{id}.yaml`            |
| **Levels**       | What career level?        | `levels.yaml`                      |
| **Tracks**       | Where/how do you work?    | `tracks/{id}.yaml`                 |
| **Skills**       | What can you do?          | `capabilities/{id}.yaml` (skills:) |
| **Behaviours**   | How do you approach work? | `behaviours/{id}.yaml`             |
| **Capabilities** | What capability area?     | `capabilities/{id}.yaml`           |
| **Stages**       | What lifecycle phase?     | `stages.yaml`                      |
| **Drivers**      | What outcomes matter?     | `drivers.yaml`                     |

| `foundational` | Can apply basics independently        |
| `working`      | Solid competence, handles ambiguity   |
| `practitioner` | Deep expertise, leads and mentors     |
| `expert`       | Authority, shapes org direction       |

## Behaviour Maturities

| Maturity        | Description                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `emerging`      | Shows interest, needs prompting   |
| `developing`    | Regular practice with guidance    |
| `practicing`    | Consistent application, proactive |
| `role_modeling` | Influences team culture           |
| `exemplifying`  | Shapes organizational culture     |
