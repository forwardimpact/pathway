# GitHub Discussions Bridge

<!-- BEGIN:description — Do not edit. Generated from package.json. -->

GitHub Discussions bridge — relay messages between GitHub Discussion threads and
the Kata agent team.

<!-- END:description -->

## Prerequisites

- The Kata Agent Team GitHub App with `discussions: write` permission and
  webhook subscriptions for `discussion` and `discussion_comment` events
  (see the kata-setup skill for initial App creation).
- An installation of that App on the target repository.
- A GitHub token with `actions:write` on the target repository.
  `libconfig` falls back to `gh auth token` when `GH_TOKEN` is not set in
  `.env`, so `gh auth login` is sufficient.

Configuration (loaded via `createServiceConfig("ghbridge")`):

| Env var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_URL` | Listen URL (default `http://localhost:8080`) |
| `SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_GITHUB_REPO` | `owner/repo` target |
| `SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` | Public URL the workflow POSTs callbacks to |
| `SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_APP_ID` | Kata App numeric id |
| `SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | PEM contents (see § Private key format) |
| `SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` | Installation id for the target repo |
| `SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Shared secret for `X-Hub-Signature-256` verification |
| `STATE_DIR` | Local directory for JSONL state (default `/var/lib/ghbridge`) |

### Private key format

The PEM file must be entered as a single line with literal `\n` replacing
each line break, wrapped in double quotes:

```
SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIE...\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

Convert a `.pem` file to this format:

```sh
awk 'NR>1{printf "\\n"}{printf "%s",$0}' path/to/your-key.pem
```

Paste the output between double quotes after the `=`.

### `STATE_DIR`

The bridge persists discussion context as JSONL via `libstorage`. Set
`STATE_DIR` in `.env` to a writable local directory (e.g.
`data/state/ghbridge`). The default `/var/lib/ghbridge` requires root on
most systems.

## Running

Add `ghtunnel` and `ghbridge` to `config/config.json` under
`init.services` — see [`config/CLAUDE.md`](../../config/CLAUDE.md) for the
entry format. List the tunnel before the bridge so that restarting the
bridge does not cycle the tunnel (declaration order determines restart
scope).

Start both services:

```sh
just rc-start
```

The tunnel uses a quick `trycloudflare.com` hostname that changes on
every restart. After starting, check the tunnel log for the assigned URL:

```sh
cat data/logs/ghtunnel/current | grep trycloudflare.com
```

### GitHub App webhook configuration

In the App settings (`github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/apps/<app>`):

1. Under **Webhook**, check **Active**.
2. Set **Webhook URL** to `https://<tunnel-domain>/api/webhook`.
3. Set **Secret** to a shared value and save the same value as
   `SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`.
4. Under **Permissions & events → Subscribe to events**, check
   **Discussions** and **Discussion comments**.
5. Save changes.

Set `SERVICE_GHBRIDGE_CALLBACK_BASE_URL` in `.env` to the tunnel domain
(without any path), then restart only the bridge:

```sh
bunx fit-rc restart ghbridge
```

The tunnel keeps its hostname across bridge restarts.

### Corporate network considerations

The bridge must be able to reach `api.github.com` to dispatch workflows
and post GraphQL replies. If you are on a corporate VPN with tenant
restrictions, disconnect before starting.

## Smoke test

Open a new GitHub Discussion in the configured repository. The bridge:

1. Verifies the `X-Hub-Signature-256` against the webhook secret.
2. Persists a `DiscussionContext` record keyed by the discussion's `node_id`.
3. Dispatches `kata-dispatch.yml` via `workflow_dispatch`.
4. Adds an "EYES" reaction to the discussion as a progress indicator.

The bridge then waits for the workflow's callback. When it arrives:

- If `verdict: "adjourned"` — each `reply` in `payload.replies` becomes a
  threaded comment via `addDiscussionComment`. The RFC is closed.
- If `verdict: "recessed"` — the bridge persists the trigger and re-dispatches
  the workflow with `resume_context` when the trigger fires.
- If `verdict: "failed"` — the summary is posted to the thread so the human
  sees the failure surface; no re-dispatch.
