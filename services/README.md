# Services

The packages under `services/` are internal microservices that back products —
exposing domain capabilities over gRPC (and MCP) for composition by any
product. Agent-friendly interfaces, observable operations, and protocol bridges
that let agents consume backend functionality natively.

## Catalog

<!-- BEGIN:catalog — Do not edit. Generated from each service's package.json. -->

| Service     | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **graph**   | RDF knowledge graph over gRPC — relationship queries without each product standing up its own store.     |
| **map**     | Activity reads and writes over gRPC — the agent-facing gateway to Map's activity database.               |
| **mcp**     | Unified MCP server — agents reach backend services as tools without per-service integration.             |
| **pathway** | Engineering standard queries over gRPC — career paths and agent profiles as derivable data for products. |
| **trace**   | OpenTelemetry span ingestion and storage over gRPC — prove whether agent changes improved outcomes.      |
| **vector**  | Vector similarity search over gRPC — semantic retrieval without a dedicated database per product.        |

## Jobs To Be Done

<job user="Platform Builders" goal="Expose Activity Data to Agents">

## Platform Builders: Expose Activity Data to Agents

**Trigger:** Building an agent feature that reads or writes activity data and
realizing the agent would need direct DB access.

**Big Hire:** Help me read and write activity data from any agent without
leaking schema or credentials. → **map**

**Little Hire:** Help me fetch unscored artifacts or write evidence rows without
touching Supabase directly. → **map**

**Competes With:** opening Supabase directly from the agent; building
per-product activity endpoints; embedding query logic in the evaluation skill.

</job>

<job user="Platform Builders" goal="Ground Agents in Context">

## Platform Builders: Ground Agents in Context

**Trigger:** Needing to know how two concepts relate and realizing the answer is
scattered across files no one wants to join by hand; adding semantic search to a
product and realizing each one would need its own vector store.

**Big Hire:** Help me traverse a knowledge graph from a product without standing
up my own store; run semantic search from any product without standing up a
per-product database. → **graph, vector**

**Little Hire:** Help me answer relationship questions without writing join
logic; search for semantically related content without managing embeddings
storage. → **graph, vector**

**Competes With:** ad-hoc joins across flat files; embedding a triple store in
each product; skipping the relationship question entirely; per-product vector
databases; keyword search instead of semantic; skipping retrieval entirely.

</job>

<job user="Platform Builders" goal="Integrate with the Engineering Standard">

## Platform Builders: Integrate with the Engineering Standard

**Trigger:** Building a product feature that needs career paths or agent
profiles and realizing the derivation logic would have to live in the product.

**Big Hire:** Help me query the engineering standard from any product without
embedding derivation logic. → **pathway**

**Little Hire:** Help me fetch a derived role or agent profile without
reimplementing the derivation. → **pathway**

**Competes With:** embedding libskill in each product; duplicating derivation
logic; hardcoding role definitions.

</job>

<job user="Platform Builders" goal="Keep Service Contracts Typed">

## Platform Builders: Keep Service Contracts Typed

**Trigger:** Adding a new gRPC service and realizing each one needs its own MCP
glue to become an agent tool.

**Big Hire:** Help me expose every backend service as agent tools through one
server. → **mcp**

**Little Hire:** Help me add a service to the MCP surface without writing
integration code. → **mcp**

**Competes With:** per-service MCP wrappers; hand-writing tool schemas for each
endpoint; leaving services unreachable by agents.

</job>

<job user="Platform Builders" goal="Prove Agent Changes">

## Platform Builders: Prove Agent Changes

**Trigger:** Finishing an agent improvement and realizing there is no
centralized place to store and compare trace spans.

**Big Hire:** Help me collect trace spans from any product without each one
managing its own storage. → **trace**

**Little Hire:** Help me send spans from a product and trust they are queryable
later. → **trace**

**Competes With:** per-product trace files; manual log comparison; skipping
observability entirely.
