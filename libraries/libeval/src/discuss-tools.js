/**
 * DiscussTools — discuss-mode tool servers. The lead's surface extends the
 * base set with two discuss-only terminal tools:
 *
 * - `Recess` suspends the session with a resumption trigger.
 * - `Adjourn` ends the discussion with a verdict.
 *
 * `Conclude` is absent — discuss mode ends via Adjourn or Recess.
 *
 * `RequestForComment` is an agent-level coordination tool — available on
 * discuss agents and facilitated agents (not leads). It opens a new
 * Discussion thread for long-horizon coordination on open questions.
 *
 * In discuss mode, each agent Answer routed to the lead is captured as a
 * thread reply delivered via the bridge callback — no explicit reply tool
 * is needed on the lead surface.
