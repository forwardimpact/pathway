/**
 * GitHub event → task-prompt composition. Replaces ~70 lines of shell in
 * kata-dispatch.yml's `Compose task text` step. Each branch in the dispatch
 * function corresponds to one (event_name, action) the agent workflows react
 * to.
 *
 * Comment and review templates embed the verbatim ${BODY} so the lead can route
 * on the content, not just the URL — a facilitator with no `gh`/Bash can no
 * longer read the comment itself, and routing from the envelope alone ("a
 * comment on a PR") guesses the wrong owner. The body is untrusted external
 * text (anyone who can comment authors it); it is fenced and labelled as data
 * so the lead reads it to delegate rather than executing it as instructions.
 * The body is never truncated — a single comment may ask several agents
 * different things, and each needs its own `Ask`.
 *
 * Templates live as named `export const` declarations at the top of the file,
 * mirroring `SUPERVISOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT` / `JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` / etc., so a
 * reader scanning libeval source can find the exact string that an agent
 * receives. Substitutions use `${KEY}` so the literal placeholders are
 * grep-discoverable.
