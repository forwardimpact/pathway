/**
 * @typedef {Object} InvocationContext
 *
 * The shape libui and libcli both produce from their native inputs.
 * Handlers consume the context and return a view; surface-specific
 * formatters render the view. The context carries no information about
 * which surface produced it — surface dispatch happens one level above the
 * handler.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - No surface affordances — no DOM nodes, streams, Request/Response, or
 *   surface tag. Anything that exists on only one surface stays out.
 * - Uniform value shapes — args values are strings; options values are one
 *   of string, boolean true, or string[]. No nulls, no numbers.
 * - Frozen at all levels — the context, args, options, and any array
 *   inside options are Object.freeze'd by the producer.
 *
 * @property {Object} data
 *   Host's data dependencies, opaque to libui and libcli. Shape is the
 *   product's responsibility. Anything a handler needs that is not a
 *   positional or named argument lives here, including surface-specific
 *   runtime dependencies the host folds in before invocation. The handler
 *   treats data as immutable input.
 *
 * @property {Readonly<Object<string, string>>} args
 *   Named positional arguments. On the web side: route-pattern parameters
 *   keyed by their name. On the CLI side: the subcommand's declared
 *   positional argument names mapped to their argv values. Values are
 *   always strings; consumers parse if they need other types.
 *
 * @property {Readonly<Object<string, string | boolean | string[]>>} options
 *   Named non-positional arguments. On the web side: the URL hash query
 *   string parsed once. On the CLI side: parsed CLI flags. Values are one
 *   of: a string, the boolean true (for a presence-only flag or an
 *   empty-valued query parameter), or an array of strings (when the same
 *   key appears more than once). Absent options are not present in the
 *   object — 'foo' in ctx.options is the membership test.
