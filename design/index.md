# Design Language

> A monochrome, character-driven design language for product suites where
> people, AI agents, and domain experts collaborate as equals. Inspired by the
> restraint of Ollama and the character-driven warmth of Go's Gopher, adapted
> for professional product suites.

This document describes the abstract design language: the philosophy, the three
characters, the scene grammar, and the cross-brand patterns for color,
typography, spacing, components, motion, and accessibility. Concrete
implementations — palette values, fonts, product taxonomies, icons, layouts, and
design tokens — live in per-brand files. Brands derive from this shared language
and stay recognizable as siblings while taking distinct stances on metaphor,
palette, and motif. The contract for deriving a brand and the layered
illustration checklist live in [usage.md](usage.md).

## 1. Design Philosophy

**Monochrome. Quiet. Purposeful. Warm at the edges.**

### Core Principles

1. **Monochrome with one warm signal.** Pure black and white base, with a single
   warm tone used sparingly for ambient warmth — campfire light on a
   black-and-white photograph. The specific warm tone is a brand decision.
2. **Texture, not decoration.** Brand-chosen textures (e.g. contour lines)
   appear as subtle background elements, never as foreground decoration.
3. **Three characters are the emotional core.** Hand-drawn monochrome figures
   replace the solo hero with a team.
4. **Typography creates hierarchy.** No accent colors. Size, weight, and spacing
   do all the work.
5. **Each product has its own visual motif.** Product-level differentiation
   happens in icons and illustrations, never in structural UI.

## 2. Character Specification

This section is the complete specification for generating the three characters.
It contains everything needed to produce them as standalone illustrations. Once
generated, characters appear in scenes governed by [§ 3](#3-scene-grammar).

### Rendering

Characters use exactly four values — white, black, and one or two grays. No
other colors, no gradients.

| Property   | Specification                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Palette    | White for all primary surfaces. Black for all lines and strokes. One or two neutral grays for secondary surfaces (clothing, hair, accessories). No other values. |
| Stroke     | 2px, pure black. No brown-black, no warm black, no dark-gray strokes.                                                                                            |
| Fills      | Flat only. No gradients, no soft shading, no drop shadows, no gradient fills.                                                                                    |
| Style      | Hand-drawn line art — like a working notebook sketch. Slightly irregular strokes, not vector-perfect.                                                            |
| Background | Transparent or pure white. Characters are drawn without scene context when generated as a character sheet.                                                       |
| Color      | None. Zero hue. Strictly achromatic. No brown, no tan, no ochre, no sepia, no cream, no beige, no warm tone of any kind.                                         |

### Shared Traits

- Round heads, simple dot eyes — expressive through posture, not facial detail
- Roughly 2:3 proportions (wide:tall), slightly cartoonish but not childish
- Same height — no hierarchy of size
- Always shown together — working side by side, consulting, collaborating. They
  replace the solo hero with a team.

### The Engineer

- Animal-eared hoodie (bunny or fox ears on the hood) — the signature element.
  The hoodie signals hacker/builder culture. Hair visible under the hoodie.
- Visible backpack — carries tools everywhere.
- Laptop with a round citrus fruit sticker (resembles Apple logo, but a citrus
  fruit instead).
- Posture: leaning in, engaged, slightly informal.
- **Identifier constraint:** never remove the hoodie ears — key identifier at
  all sizes.

### The AI Agent

- Round circle head, two large dot eyes, small curved smile.
- Headphones wrapping around the head — suggests active listening.
- Small backpack like the others — deployed alongside humans, not above them.
- Simple geometric body — more geometric than the human characters.
- Laptop (pixel-art skull or space-invader sticker optional).
- Posture: upright, attentive, slightly turned toward others.
- **Identifier constraint:** never make the AI Agent visually dominant — equal
  partner, same height, not floating above.

### The Business Stakeholder

- Business attire: collared shirt, tie, blazer. Neat hair, formal posture.
- **No backpack** — the domain expert who already knows the territory.
  Represents leadership and domain experts who define what good looks like.
- Laptop with a Claude Code sticker.
- Posture: engaged but composed, professional.
- **Identifier constraint:** never put a backpack on the Stakeholder — absence
  is their trait.

### Group Dynamic

- Seated shoulder to shoulder, each on their own laptop — equals collaborating.
- Emotional tone: "We're figuring this out together."
- Candid sketch of a working session, not a posed team photo.
- Close enough that elbows might bump.

### Scale

48px (small inline) to 400px+ (hero). At small sizes, reduce to silhouettes
preserving key identifiers: hoodie ears, round robot head, tie.

## 3. Scene Grammar

This section defines the rules for composing any scene with the characters from
[§ 2](#2-character-specification). Individual scene prompts
([§ 4](#4-reusable-base-scenes) and brand scene files) describe specific poses,
objects, and interactions — they should not restate these rules.

The entire scene uses the same small palette as the character sheet in
[§ 2](#2-character-specification): white for primary surfaces, black for lines,
and one or two neutral grays for secondary surfaces. No other values, no
gradients.

### Scene Rendering

| Property   | Specification                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Palette    | White, black, one or two grays — nothing else                                                                                                                |
| White      | Dominant value. Most of the image is white, no large gray surfaces.                                                                                          |
| Background | Pure white — no fills, textures, or shading                                                                                                                  |
| Ground     | Implied by positioning — no drawn ground line, no ground plane, no floor shadow, no scattered objects on the ground. Characters float on white.              |
| Objects    | 2px black stroke, light flat gray. Simpler than characters. Only objects named in the scene prompt — never add extra props, debris, or environmental detail. |
| Fills      | Flat only — no gradients, no shading, no tinting                                                                                                             |
| Detail     | Minimum strokes needed. No hatching, no texture, no decoration.                                                                                              |

### Composition

| Rule     | Specification                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grouping | Shoulders overlapping or nearly touching — one cluster, not three separate figures. No vertical gap between any two characters. |
| Space    | Generous white space around the cluster                                                                                         |
| Framing  | Floats freely — never outlined or bordered                                                                                      |
| Scale    | 120px (cards) to 480px+ (hero)                                                                                                  |
| Tone     | Curious, conspiratorial, scrappy — three people who chose this                                                                  |

### Constraints

- **Identity** — each character keeps its [§ 2](#2-character-specification)
  traits. Never swap accessories or features between characters. The Stakeholder
  never has a backpack — absence is their identifier. The Engineer always has
  one.
- **Foreground** — characters are the most detailed elements. Background objects
  use fewer strokes, lighter gray, and smaller scale than characters. If a
  background element is as bold as a character, simplify it.
- **Collaborative** — never show conflict.
- **Monochrome** — gray for differentiation, never hues.
- **Laptops when seated** — seated characters always have laptops.
- **No framing** — no borders, containers, or panel edges.

## 4. Reusable Base Scenes

These scenes show the trio without product-specific symbols and are reusable
across brands and contexts.

### Scene: Trio at Work (Default)

**Context:** Hero illustrations, suite-level marketing, default state.

```
     🐰💻   🤖💻   👔💻
      \      |      /
       (huddled together)
```

All three seated side by side, each with a laptop. Engineer left, cross-legged
on the ground, laptop balanced on one knee, leaning sideways to peek at Agent's
screen. AI Agent center, seated upright on a chair, head tilted slightly — the
only one with correct posture. Stakeholder right, chair tipped back on two legs,
one arm draped over the backrest, typing one-handed. Shoulders overlapping.
Brand-specific product icons may appear in a row below.

**Key details:** The trio sits at different heights — Engineer on the floor,
Agent on a chair, Stakeholder tipped back — creating a diagonal line that feels
informal and alive. Engineer is clearly nosing at someone else's screen.
Stakeholder's tipped chair says "I've done this before." Agent's perfect posture
is the deadpan counterpoint. The energy is a late-night hackathon that happens
to include someone in a blazer.

### Scene: Welcome Wave

**Context:** Onboarding screens, first-time user experience, landing page.

```
    🐰🖐   🤖🖐   👔🖐
     hey!!   hello.   welcome.
```

All three standing, facing the viewer. Engineer mid-stride toward the viewer,
both arms out wide — too enthusiastic, slightly off-balance, hoodie ears
bouncing. AI Agent stands still, one hand raised in a precise right-angle wave,
head tilted in greeting. Stakeholder one step behind, hand raised palm-out at
shoulder height — the composed anchor. Feet visible, small action lines around
Engineer's movement.

**Key details:** Engineer's over-eager stride forward creates the energy.
Agent's geometric wave is the visual punchline — friendly but mechanically
precise. Stakeholder's measured gesture grounds it: "Don't worry, we're
professional too." The three different levels of enthusiasm tell you everything
about the team dynamic in one frame.

### Scene: Documentation Dig

**Context:** Documentation pages, knowledge base, "getting started" flows.

```
    🐰📄  🤖📚  👔📖
     \     |     /
    ┌──────────────┐
    │ papers books │
    └──────────────┘
       📄  📄
```

All three standing behind a waist-high table covered with documents. Engineer
(left) holds a single sheet in both hands, head tilted, brow furrowed —
squinting at it with a puzzled expression. AI Agent (center) stands behind a
neatly organized stack of papers, both hands resting on the pile. Stakeholder
(right) smiles and points with one index finger at a specific line in an open
book on the table. Loose papers scattered on the floor under and around the
table.

**Key details:** Three speeds of documentation work: Engineer still deciphering
a single page, Agent already organized, Stakeholder already found the answer and
is pointing it out. The loose papers on the floor beneath the table are the
punchline — documentation is messy work. Agent's neat stack in the center is the
visual anchor between Engineer's confusion and Stakeholder's confidence.

## 5. Color Philosophy

**Monochrome with one warm signal.**

The base palette is pure black through pure white via a ramp of warm-tinted
grays. All grays carry a slight warm shift (~3–5%, pulling toward brown or
taupe) so the difference accumulates across a page — warmer, more human, like
paper.

A single warm tone (e.g. sandstone, ochre, clay) is layered on top:

- **Used in backgrounds and borders, never in text or interactive elements.**
- **Ambient — parchment showing through the ink.**
- Provides a small ramp (50, 100, 200, 400, 600) for warm surfaces, selected
  cards, warm borders, and the rare warm accent.

Brands choose:

- The exact warm-tinted gray ramp (typically `--white`, `--white-warm`,
  `--gray-50` … `--gray-900`, `--black`).
- The warm-signal hue and its small ramp.
- Inverted treatments for dark surfaces (footers, terminals).

See [fit/index.md § Color Palette](fit/index.md#4-color-palette) for one
concrete realization.

## 6. Typography Pattern

**Display serif. Sans for everything else. Mono for code.**

| Role               | Family     |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| **Display / Hero** | Serif      |
| **Headings**       | Sans-serif |
| **Body**           | Sans-serif |
| **Mono / Code**    | Monospace  |

The serif/sans pairing creates hierarchy beyond size and weight. The serif
anchors the brand's character — what it specifically evokes is a brand decision
(e.g. field journals, training manuals, archival records). Brands choose the
specific families and the type scale; the pairing pattern is fixed.

A typical scale spans hero (≈ 64px serif) → display (≈ 44px serif) → h1–h3
(sans, 32/24/20px) → body (16px) → small/badge/mono (14/12/14px). Colors follow
the brand's gray ramp.

## 7. Spacing System

Base unit: `8px`. The rhythm extends from micro gaps to hero-scale margins.

| Token        | Value | Usage                               |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| `--space-1`  | 4px   | Micro gaps, icon internal spacing   |
| `--space-2`  | 8px   | Tight element gaps, pill padding    |
| `--space-3`  | 12px  | Badge padding, small card gaps      |
| `--space-4`  | 16px  | Default gaps, paragraph spacing     |
| `--space-6`  | 24px  | Card padding, element group spacing |
| `--space-8`  | 32px  | Between content blocks              |
| `--space-10` | 40px  | Section subtitle to content         |
| `--space-12` | 48px  | Between related sections            |
| `--space-16` | 64px  | Major section breaks                |
| `--space-20` | 80px  | Hero internal padding               |
| `--space-24` | 96px  | Top-level section margins           |
| `--space-32` | 128px | Hero top breathing room             |

### Key Spacing Guidelines

- **Hero top padding**: `128px` from nav to first content
- **Between major page sections**: `96–128px`
- **Card internal padding**: `24–32px`
- **Minimum touch target**: `44px` (accessibility)

### Content Width

| Context               | Max Width |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Page container        | `1120px`  |
| Hero text block       | `640px`   |
| Prose / documentation | `680px`   |
| Card grid             | `1120px`  |

| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **Primary**   | darkest gray | none                      | white           | `999px` | `14px 28px` |
| **Secondary** | white        | `1.5px solid` strong gray | darkest gray    | `999px` | `14px 28px` |
| **Ghost**     | transparent  | none                      | dark gray + `→` | —       | `0`         |
| **Product**   | white        | `1.5px solid` strong gray | darkest gray    | `12px`  | `14px 24px` |

All buttons: sans-serif `15px`, weight `500`. Pill radius for marketing CTAs,
`12px` for in-app. Ghost buttons always include `→`.

## 9. Motion & Interaction

| Element                | Animation                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Page load**          | Hero stagger: scene (0ms) → heading (100ms) → subtitle (200ms) → CTAs (300ms). 500ms ease-out. |
| **Trio idle**          | Subtle sway per character (`translateY` ±2px, staggered 3s/3.4s/2.8s, infinite).               |
| **Product card hover** | Icon ±3° wiggle, card lifts 2px, border warms. 200ms.                                          |
| **Button hover**       | Background transition, 150ms. Primary adds warm shadow.                                        |
| **Section enter**      | Fade up on scroll (`translateY(16px)` → `0`, 400ms).                                           |
| **Nav product switch** | Underline slides, 200ms ease-in-out.                                                           |

All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 10. Accessibility

| Concern                   | Solution                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color-only indicators** | Not applicable — monochrome uses shape, size, weight, position                                  |
| **Contrast ratios**       | Black-on-white = 21:1. Body gray-on-white must meet AA (≥ 4.5:1). Large text may meet AA-large. |
| **Focus states**          | 2px solid darkest-gray outline with 2px offset                                                  |
| **Motion sensitivity**    | All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`                                                 |
| **Dark mode**             | Invert system — darkest gray bg, warm-light text, white-on-dark line art                        |
| **Scene alt text**        | All scenes include descriptive alt text identifying roles and action                            |
