# @forwardimpact/model

Derivation engine for roles, skills, and AI agent profiles.

## Role in the Vision

The model package contains the core logic that transforms raw data into
actionable role definitions. Whether you're generating a human job description
or an AI agent profile, the same derivation engine ensures consistent
expectations across both.

## What It Does

- **Job derivation** — Combine discipline, track, and grade into complete role
  definitions with skill matrices and behaviour profiles
- **Agent profiles** — Generate AI coding agent configurations from the same
  foundation as human roles
- **Interview preparation** — Select appropriate questions based on role
  requirements
- **Career progression** — Analyze skill gaps and growth paths between grades
- **Checklists** — Derive stage transition checklists from capability
  definitions

## Usage

```javascript
import {
  deriveJob,
  deriveSkillMatrix,
  deriveBehaviourProfile,
} from "@forwardimpact/model/derivation";
import { prepareAgentProfile } from "@forwardimpact/model/profile";
import { deriveInterviewQuestions } from "@forwardimpact/model/interview";
import { analyzeProgression } from "@forwardimpact/model/progression";
```

## Key Concepts

### Job Derivation

```
Job = Discipline × Track × Grade
```

- **Discipline** defines skill tiers (primary/secondary/broad)
- **Track** applies modifiers to capability areas
- **Grade** sets base skill levels

### Agent Profiles

```
Agent = Discipline × Track × Stage
```

Uses the same skill derivation but filtered for AI-applicable capabilities and
constrained by lifecycle stage (plan, code, review).
