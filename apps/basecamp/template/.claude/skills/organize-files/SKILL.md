# Organize Files

Organize, tidy up, and find files in `~/Desktop/` and `~/Downloads/`. Always
previews changes before acting and never deletes without explicit confirmation.

After organizing, extract entities from document files by invoking the
**`extract-entities`** skill.

## Trigger

Run when the user asks to find, organize, clean up, or tidy files on their Mac.

## Prerequisites

- macOS filesystem access

## Inputs

- User's description of what to organize or find
- Source directories: `~/Desktop/` and `~/Downloads/`

## Outputs

- Organized files moved to logical subdirectories within `~/Desktop/` and
  `~/Downloads/`
- Entity extraction triggered on document files via the **`extract-entities`**
  skill
- Summary of actions taken

---

## Core Capabilities

1. **Find files** — Locate files by name, type, or content in `~/Desktop/` and
   `~/Downloads/`
2. **Organize files** — Move files into logical subfolders
3. **Tidy up** — Clean up cluttered `~/Desktop/` and `~/Downloads/`
4. **Create structure** — Set up folder hierarchies
5. **Extract entities** — After organizing, invoke the **`extract-entities`**
   skill on document files to populate the knowledge graph

## Key Principles

**Always preview before acting:**

- Show what files will be affected BEFORE moving/deleting
- List proposed changes and ask for confirmation

**Be conservative with destructive operations:**

- Never delete without explicit confirmation
- Prefer moving to a "to-review" folder over deleting

## Summarizing Contents

Get an overview of both directories:

    bash scripts/summarize.sh

## Finding Files

```bash
find ~/Downloads -maxdepth 1 -name "*.pdf" -type f
find ~/Desktop -maxdepth 1 -iname "*AI*" -type f
find ~/Desktop -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg" \)
find ~/Downloads -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime -7     # last 7 days
find ~/Downloads -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +30    # older than 30 days
find ~/Desktop -maxdepth 1 \( -name "Screenshot*" -o -name "Screen Shot*" \)
```

## Organizing by File Type

Organize a directory into type-based subdirectories (Documents, Images,
Archives, Installers, Screenshots):

    bash scripts/organize-by-type.sh ~/Downloads
    bash scripts/organize-by-type.sh ~/Desktop

The script creates subdirectories and moves matching files. It does NOT delete
anything.

## Entity Extraction

After organizing files, identify document files that may contain entity
information (people, organizations, projects, topics) and invoke the
**`extract-entities`** skill to process them.

### Which files to send for extraction

**Include:** `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.rtf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`

**Exclude:** Images, installers, archives, media, system files

### How to invoke

After organizing, collect the paths of document files and invoke the
**`extract-entities`** skill, passing the file paths as ad-hoc file inputs.

## Output Format

**Plan:**

```
Organization Plan: Desktop & Downloads Cleanup

Found 47 files to organize:
- 23 screenshots → ~/Desktop/Screenshots/
- 12 PDFs → ~/Downloads/Documents/
- 8 images → ~/Downloads/Images/
- 4 DMGs → ~/Downloads/Installers/

Document files for entity extraction: 12
→ Will invoke extract-entities skill after organizing

Should I proceed?
```

**Results:**

```
Organization Complete

Moved 47 files:
- 23 screenshots to ~/Desktop/Screenshots/
- 12 PDFs to ~/Downloads/Documents/
- 8 images to ~/Downloads/Images/
- 4 DMGs to ~/Downloads/Installers/

Entity extraction: invoked extract-entities on 12 document files
```

## Safety Rules

1. **Never delete without permission** — "cleanup" means organize, not delete
2. **Don't touch system folders** — /System, /Library, /Applications
3. **Don't touch hidden files** — files starting with `.` unless asked
4. **Limit scope** — only operate on `~/Desktop/` and `~/Downloads/`
5. **Limit depth** — use `-maxdepth 1` unless user wants recursive
6. **Show before doing** — always preview first
7. **Quote paths** — handle spaces: `"$HOME/My Documents"`
