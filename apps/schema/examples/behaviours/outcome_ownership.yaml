name: Own the Outcome
human:
  description:
    Business outcomes trump engineering elegance. Embrace extreme ownership of
    what you build—not just code quality, but business relationships, impact
    metrics, and end-to-end results. Accept technical debt when it enables
    faster business value, but own the consequences. AI may generate the code,
    but responsibility for outcomes remains with you.
  maturityDescriptions:
    emerging:
      Takes responsibility for assigned tasks with supervision; follows through
      when reminded; asks for help appropriately; understands that work serves
      business goals
    developing:
      Owns task completion independently; reviews AI-generated code critically;
      makes pragmatic trade-offs between speed and polish; takes responsibility
      for understanding code before shipping; considers business impact of
      technical decisions
    practicing:
      Takes end-to-end ownership of features and business outcomes; accepts
      technical debt intentionally when it accelerates value; builds trust
      through rapid delivery of working solutions; owns stakeholder
      relationships; balances quality with delivery speed
    role_modeling:
      Drives accountability culture focused on outcomes not deliverables; owns
      business relationships and impact metrics across their function; makes
      trade-offs between custom solutions and generalizable work; there is no "I
      must run this by X"; ensures verification rigor for AI-generated code
    exemplifying:
      Defines organizational accountability standards focused on business
      impact; shapes industry practices around outcome ownership in the AI era;
      sponsors transformational initiatives with full outcome accountability;
      recognized externally for ownership culture leadership

    At each step:
    1. Define success criteria before starting
    2. Verify the change achieves the criteria
    3. Don't hand off until you've validated the work
