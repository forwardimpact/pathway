      A new client needs a dashboard that shows real-time analytics for their
      e-commerce platform. Walk me through how you would approach this.
    context:
      The client has 50,000 daily active users, uses PostgreSQL for their main
      database, and wants the dashboard within 6 weeks.
    decompositionPrompts:
      - What information would you need to gather first?
      - How would you break down the technical implementation?
      - What are the biggest risks and how would you mitigate them?
      - How would you prioritize if you had only 3 weeks instead?
    lookingFor:
      - Asks clarifying questions about requirements before diving in
      - Identifies data pipeline, storage, and visualization as separate
        concerns
      - Considers real-time vs near-real-time trade-offs
      - Thinks about scalability and performance constraints
    expectedDurationMinutes: 15
    followUps:
      - What would you do differently if their data was in 5 different systems?
      - How would you handle if a key team member left mid-project?

      Your team needs to migrate a critical monolith to microservices while
      keeping the system running. How would you approach this?
    context:
      The monolith handles payment processing, has 99.99% uptime requirements,
      and the team has 8 engineers.
    decompositionPrompts:
      - How would you decide what to extract first?
      - What's your strategy for maintaining reliability during the migration?
      - How would you structure the team's work?
      - What would success look like at each phase?
    lookingFor:
      - Proposes strangler fig or similar incremental approach
      - Identifies domain boundaries as extraction points
      - Plans for rollback and feature flags
      - Considers team coordination and parallel workstreams
    expectedDurationMinutes: 15
    followUps:
      - How would you handle if stakeholders wanted everything migrated in 6
        months?
      - What metrics would you track to know the migration is succeeding?
