        A new client needs a dashboard that shows real-time analytics for their
        e-commerce platform. Walk me through how you would approach this.
      context:

        - How would you break down the technical implementation?
        - What are the biggest risks and how would you mitigate them?
        - How would you prioritize if you had only 3 weeks instead?
      lookingFor:
        - Asks clarifying questions about requirements before diving in
        - Identifies data pipeline, storage, and visualization as separate
          concerns
        - Considers real-time vs near-real-time trade-offs
        - Thinks about scalability and performance constraints
