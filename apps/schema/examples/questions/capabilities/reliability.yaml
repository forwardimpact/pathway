      Your service experienced three outages in the past month, each from
      different root causes. How would you approach improving reliability?
    context:
      The outages were caused by database connection exhaustion, a failed
      deployment, and an upstream dependency timeout. SLO is 99.9% and you're
      currently at 99.5%.
    decompositionPrompts:
      - How would you categorize and analyze these incidents?
      - What systematic improvements would you prioritize?
      - How would you balance reliability investment with feature work?
      - What would success look like 3 months from now?
    lookingFor:
      - Looks for patterns across incidents rather than treating in isolation
      - Proposes both reactive fixes and proactive improvements
      - Creates measurable reliability targets
      - Considers observability and early warning systems
    expectedDurationMinutes: 15
    followUps:
      - What if leadership is pressuring for more features over reliability
        work?
      - How would you structure the team's on-call rotation going forward?

      You're designing the disaster recovery strategy for a system that
      processes customer financial transactions. Walk me through your approach.
    context:
      The system handles $10M in daily transactions, uses AWS in us-east-1, and
      currently has no cross-region capability. Budget for DR is $50K annual.
    decompositionPrompts:
      - What are the key requirements you need to establish first?
      - How would you structure the technical options analysis?
      - What trade-offs would you present to stakeholders?
      - How would you test and validate the DR plan?
    lookingFor:
      - Defines RTO/RPO requirements with business stakeholders
      - Evaluates active-active vs active-passive vs pilot light approaches
      - Balances cost against recovery capabilities
      - Plans for regular testing and runbook maintenance
    expectedDurationMinutes: 15
    followUps:
      - What would you do if a regional outage happened before DR was complete?
      - How would you handle if the $50K budget was cut in half?
