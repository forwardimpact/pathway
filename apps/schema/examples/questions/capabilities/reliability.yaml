        Your service experienced three outages in the past month, each from
        different root causes. How would you approach improving reliability?
      context:
        The outages were caused by database connection exhaustion, a failed
        deployment, and an upstream dependency timeout. SLO is 99.9% and you're
        currently at 99.5%.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you categorize and analyze these incidents?
        - What systematic improvements would you prioritize?
        - How would you balance reliability investment with feature work?
        - What would success look like 3 months from now?
      lookingFor:
        - Looks for patterns across incidents rather than treating in isolation
        - Proposes both reactive fixes and proactive improvements
        - Creates measurable reliability targets
        - Considers observability and early warning systems
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if leadership is pressuring for more features over reliability
          work?
        - How would you structure the team's on-call rotation going forward?

        You're designing the disaster recovery strategy for a system that
        processes customer financial transactions. Walk me through your
        approach.
      context:
        The system handles $10M in daily transactions, uses AWS in us-east-1,
        and currently has no cross-region capability. Budget for DR is $50K
        annual.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - What are the key requirements you need to establish first?
        - How would you structure the technical options analysis?
        - What trade-offs would you present to stakeholders?
        - How would you test and validate the DR plan?
      lookingFor:
        - Defines RTO/RPO requirements with business stakeholders
        - Evaluates active-active vs active-passive vs pilot light approaches
        - Balances cost against recovery capabilities
        - Plans for regular testing and runbook maintenance
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What would you do if a regional outage happened before DR was
          complete?
        - How would you handle if the $50K budget was cut in half?

        Your team's on-call rotation is burning people out. Three engineers have
        complained about being paged too frequently. How would you address this?
      context:
        The team of 6 handles on-call for 3 services. Page volume is 40 per
        week, with 60% being false alarms or low-priority. Two engineers are
        considering leaving due to on-call burden.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you assess the current on-call health?
        - What changes would you prioritize to reduce burden?
        - How would you balance immediate relief with long-term fixes?
        - How would you rebuild team trust around on-call?
      lookingFor:
        - Takes retention risk seriously
        - Analyzes page sources to prioritize fixes
        - Considers short-term accommodations while fixing root causes
        - Involves team in designing sustainable solutions
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if you couldn't reduce page volume quickly?
        - How would you handle if leadership wanted to add a fourth service?

        After a major incident, your team's postmortem revealed significant
        process and communication failures. How would you drive organizational
        improvements?
      context:
        The incident lasted 4 hours and impacted $500K in transactions. Root
        causes included unclear escalation paths, lack of runbooks, and poor
        cross-team communication. Multiple teams were involved.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you prioritize the improvements identified?
        - How would you build consensus across teams and leadership?
        - What governance would you establish to ensure follow-through?
        - How would you measure whether improvements are working?
      lookingFor:
        - Focuses on systemic issues rather than individual blame
        - Creates cross-functional alignment on improvements
        - Establishes accountability for action items
        - Builds culture of continuous reliability improvement
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if other teams resisted changes to their processes?
        - How would you handle pressure to move on without implementing fixes?
