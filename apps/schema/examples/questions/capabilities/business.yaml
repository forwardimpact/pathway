      The product team wants to add a feature that will increase revenue but
      requires significant technical investment. How would you evaluate this?
    context:
      The feature is an AI-powered recommendation engine. Product estimates 15%
      revenue increase. Your team estimates 4 months of work and ongoing
      maintenance costs.
    decompositionPrompts:
      - What questions would you ask the product team?
      - How would you break down the technical cost assessment?
      - What factors would influence your recommendation?
      - How would you present your analysis to stakeholders?
    lookingFor:
      - Balances business value against technical cost
      - Considers ongoing maintenance and operational complexity
      - Asks about success metrics and measurement approach
      - Thinks about alternatives and build vs buy decisions
    expectedDurationMinutes: 15
    followUps:
      - What if the CEO strongly favors this feature but your analysis suggests
        otherwise?
      - How would you handle if the revenue estimate turned out to be
        optimistic?

    text:
      Your company is considering entering a new market that requires different
      compliance requirements. How would you approach the technical evaluation?
    context:
      The new market is healthcare (HIPAA compliance). Current systems handle
      financial data but were not designed for healthcare. Leadership wants a
      go/no-go decision in 4 weeks.
    decompositionPrompts:
      - What stakeholders need to be involved in this assessment?
      - How would you structure the technical gap analysis?
      - What are the key decision points you need to surface?
      - How would you communicate risk and uncertainty to leadership?
    lookingFor:
      - Identifies compliance, security, and data handling as separate
        workstreams
      - Involves legal, security, and product stakeholders appropriately
      - Creates structured assessment with clear criteria
      - Communicates uncertainty and risk levels clearly
    expectedDurationMinutes: 15
    followUps:
      - What would change if you had 3 months instead of 4 weeks?
      - How would you handle if different stakeholders had conflicting
        priorities?
