        Your API currently handles 100 requests per second but needs to handle
        1000 RPS in 6 months due to a new partnership. How would you approach
        this?
      context:
        The API is a monolithic Node.js application backed by PostgreSQL.
        Response time P99 is currently 200ms and must stay under 500ms.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - What would you need to measure and understand first?
        - How would you identify the scaling bottlenecks?
        - What architectural changes would you consider?
        - How would you phase the work and validate progress?
      lookingFor:
        - Profiles current system before jumping to solutions
        - Considers horizontal vs vertical scaling trade-offs
        - Identifies database as likely bottleneck
        - Plans incremental validation with load testing
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if the partnership deal accelerated and you had only 3 months?
        - How would you handle if the new load had very different access
          patterns?

        Your team maintains a data pipeline that processes events from multiple
        sources. It's becoming increasingly difficult to add new sources. How
        would you redesign it?
      context:
        Currently there are 15 event sources, each with custom integration code.
        Adding a new source takes 3 weeks. The team receives requests for 5 new
        sources per quarter.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you analyze the current pain points systematically?
        - What abstractions or patterns would improve extensibility?
        - How would you migrate existing sources without disruption?
        - How would you measure the success of the redesign?
      lookingFor:
        - Identifies common patterns across existing integrations
        - Proposes schema standardization or adapter pattern
        - Plans migration that doesn't break existing functionality
        - Sets concrete targets for new source onboarding time
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if different sources had fundamentally incompatible data models?
        - How would you get buy-in if the team is skeptical of a major rewrite?

      text:
        Your team's codebase has grown significantly and new engineers are
        taking much longer to become productive. How would you address this?
      context:
        Onboarding time has increased from 2 weeks to 6 weeks. The codebase has
        300K lines of code with limited documentation. You're planning to hire 3
        more engineers this quarter.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you assess what's causing the onboarding slowdown?
        - What investments would you prioritize to improve the situation?
        - How would you balance documentation work with feature delivery?
        - How would you measure improvement over time?
      lookingFor:
        - Investigates root causes systematically
        - Considers documentation, tooling, and mentorship investments
        - Creates sustainable approach that doesn't overburden existing team
        - Sets concrete onboarding time targets
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if senior engineers resisted taking time for documentation?
        - How would you handle pressure to start new hires on features
          immediately?

      text:
        Your organization wants to scale from 3 engineering teams to 8 teams
        over the next year. You've been asked to help plan the team structure
        and architecture evolution. How would you approach this?
      context:
        Current teams are organized by layer (frontend, backend,
        infrastructure). The product is a B2B SaaS platform with 5 major feature
        areas. Current architecture is a monolith with some extracted services.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - What factors would drive your team topology recommendations?
        - How would you align architecture changes with team growth?
        - What challenges do you anticipate and how would you mitigate them?
        - How would you phase the transition?
      lookingFor:
        - Considers domain-driven team boundaries
        - Aligns architecture evolution with organizational design
        - Plans for communication overhead and coordination costs
        - Anticipates cultural and process challenges of rapid growth
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if leadership wanted to move faster than you recommended?
        - How would you handle if existing teams resisted reorganization?
