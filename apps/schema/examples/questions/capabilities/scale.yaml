      Your API currently handles 100 requests per second but needs to handle
      1000 RPS in 6 months due to a new partnership. How would you approach
      this?
    context:
      The API is a monolithic Node.js application backed by PostgreSQL. Response
      time P99 is currently 200ms and must stay under 500ms.
    decompositionPrompts:
      - What would you need to measure and understand first?
      - How would you identify the scaling bottlenecks?
      - What architectural changes would you consider?
      - How would you phase the work and validate progress?
    lookingFor:
      - Profiles current system before jumping to solutions
      - Considers horizontal vs vertical scaling trade-offs
      - Identifies database as likely bottleneck
      - Plans incremental validation with load testing
    expectedDurationMinutes: 15
    followUps:
      - What if the partnership deal accelerated and you had only 3 months?
      - How would you handle if the new load had very different access patterns?

    text:
      Your team maintains a data pipeline that processes events from multiple
      sources. It's becoming increasingly difficult to add new sources. How
      would you redesign it?
    context:
      Currently there are 15 event sources, each with custom integration code.
      Adding a new source takes 3 weeks. The team receives requests for 5 new
      sources per quarter.
    decompositionPrompts:
      - How would you analyze the current pain points systematically?
      - What abstractions or patterns would improve extensibility?
      - How would you migrate existing sources without disruption?
      - How would you measure the success of the redesign?
    lookingFor:
      - Identifies common patterns across existing integrations
      - Proposes schema standardization or adapter pattern
      - Plans migration that doesn't break existing functionality
      - Sets concrete targets for new source onboarding time
    expectedDurationMinutes: 15
    followUps:
      - What if different sources had fundamentally incompatible data models?
      - How would you get buy-in if the team is skeptical of a major rewrite?
