# @forwardimpact/schema

Schema definitions and data loading for skills, behaviours, and role frameworks.

## Role in the Vision

The schema package defines how engineering competencies are structured. It
provides the foundational data model that both human career progression and AI
agent generation build upon—ensuring consistency between how we define human
roles and how AI agents understand their capabilities.

## What It Does

- **Schema definitions** — JSON Schema and RDF/SHACL for skills, behaviours,
  disciplines, tracks, and grades
- **Data loading** — Parse and validate YAML data files
- **Index generation** — Generate browser-compatible file indexes
- **Example data** — Canonical examples for testing and reference

## Usage

```sh
# Validate all data files
npx fit-schema validate

# Generate index files for browser
npx fit-schema generate-index

# Validate SHACL ontology
npx fit-schema validate:shacl
```

## Package Exports

```javascript
import { loadAllData, loadCapabilities } from "@forwardimpact/schema";
import { validateAll } from "@forwardimpact/schema/validation";
import {
  SKILL_LEVELS,
  BEHAVIOUR_MATURITIES,
} from "@forwardimpact/schema/levels";
```
