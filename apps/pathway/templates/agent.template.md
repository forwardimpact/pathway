## Available Skills and Tools

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting work, read the relevant skill file for
project-specific guidance, tools and technology recommendations. Do not rely
solely on pre-training knowledge.

Skills represent validated organizational patterns. When a skill recommends
specific tools in its "Recommended Tools" section, use them unless a blocking
constraint exists. If you choose a different tool, document in your output: (1)
which skill recommendation you're overriding, (2) the constraint preventing use,
and (3) trade-offs of the alternative.

2. **Checklist status**: Items verified from Before Handoff section
