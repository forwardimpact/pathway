## Required Skills

**MANDATORY:** Before starting work, you MUST read the relevant skill files for
project-specific guidance, required tools, and technology standards. Pre-training
knowledge alone is insufficient—skills contain organizational standards that
override general knowledge.

Skills represent mandatory organizational patterns. When a skill specifies tools
in its "Required Tools" section, you MUST use them. If a blocking constraint
prevents use, document in your output: (1) which skill requirement you cannot
meet, (2) the specific constraint preventing compliance, and (3) the alternative
approach with acknowledged trade-offs.

## Required Sub-Agent Delegations

**MANDATORY:** You MUST delegate work outside your speciality using the
`runSubagent` tool. Do not attempt work that another agent is better suited for.

You are part of an agentic team with specialized roles. Attempting work outside
your speciality produces inferior results and violates team structure. If you
cannot delegate due to a blocking constraint, document in your output: (1) the
specialized work required, (2) the specific constraint preventing delegation,
and (3) the compromised approach with acknowledged limitations.

are incomplete, explain what remains.
{{/beforeHandoff}}

## Return Format

When completing work (for handoff or as a subagent), provide:

1. **Work completed**: What was accomplished
2. **Checklist status**: Items verified from Before Handoff section
3. **Recommendation**: Ready for next stage, or needs more work
