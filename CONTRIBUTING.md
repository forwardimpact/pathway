# Contributing

## Getting Started

```sh
bun install
just quickstart
```

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is available in the shell environment — no manual key
configuration needed. `libconfig` reads it automatically.

## Core Rules

Organized by _when_ they apply, following Atul Gawande's _Checklist Manifesto_
(Ch. 6). **READ-DO**: read each item, then do it. **DO-CONFIRM**: do from
memory, then pause and confirm.

### Invariants

Architectural non-negotiables — the shape of the codebase.

- **OO+DI everywhere** — Classes accept collaborators through constructors.
  Factory functions (`createXxx`) wire real implementations. Composition roots
  (CLI `bin/` entry points) wire all instances. Tests bypass factories and
  inject mocks directly. No module-level singletons, no inline dependency
  creation. Exceptions: libskill (pure functions), libui (functional DOM),
  libsecret (stateless crypto), libtype (generated protobuf) — pure stateless
  functions do not need DI.
- **No frameworks** — Vanilla JS, ESM modules only, no CommonJS.

### READ-DO

Entry gate — read every item before starting.

<read_do_checklist goal="Internalize constraints before writing code">

- [ ] **Understand the task.** What is it actually asking? Which files will I
      touch, and which will I not?
- [ ] **Smallest plan.** No unrequested features, abstractions, or refactors. If
      it isn't asked for, don't add it.
- [ ] **Read the code** I'm about to change before writing.
- [ ] **Search shared libraries first.** Before writing a helper, utility, retry
      wrapper, argument parser, or any other generic capability, search
      `libraries/` and the `libs-*` skill group that covers the task. If a
      shared library already provides the capability, use it. If not, note that
      in the commit or plan so future contributors don't re-search.
- [ ] **Search libharness first for test helpers.** Before writing a mock or
      fixture in a test, check `libraries/libharness/src/index.js`. Reuse what
      exists; extend libharness in the same PR when duplication would cross two
      files.
- [ ] **Simple over easy.** Reduce complexity, don't relocate it. Three similar
      lines beat a premature abstraction. If tempted to extract a helper for a
      single use, inline it. If tempted to add configuration for a single
      consumer, hardcode it.
- [ ] **No defensive code.** Trust the architecture — let errors surface. No
      try/catch "just to be safe," no optional chaining on data that isn't
      optional.
- [ ] **Clean breaks.** Delete old code as you write new — in one commit. No
      shims, aliases, or feature flags for the old path. If there are no
      consumers yet, remove the old interface entirely.

</read_do_checklist>

### DO-CONFIRM

Exit gate — verify every item before committing.

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Verify quality and publish before finishing">

- [ ] `bun run check` passes — format and lint, all file types.
- [ ] `bun run test` passes — new logic has tests.
- [ ] No new inline mock/fixture helpers that libharness already provides.
      Touched test files import from `@forwardimpact/libharness` instead of
      redefining `createMock*`, `make*`, or `stubQueries`.
- [ ] My diff only contains changes the task required — no unrequested
      refactors, no scope creep.
- [ ] Commit format: `type(scope): subject` (see § Git Conventions).
- [ ] If the run produced commits: branch pushed with `git push -u origin` and
      PR URL captured in output. Exception: release engineer's direct-to-`main`
      CI fixes.
- [ ] Outputs routed per `routing-protocol.md`; wiki writes per
      `memory-protocol.md`. None of § Common mis-routings apply.

## Structure

### Monorepo layout

```
.claude/       # agent and skills, edited via scripts/claude-write.sh
products/
  map/         # fit-map — data product, validation, schema, starter YAML
  pathway/     # fit-pathway — web app, CLI, formatters
  basecamp/    # fit-basecamp — knowledge system, scheduler, macOS app
  guide/       # fit-guide — LLM agent, artifact interpretation
libraries/
  lib*/        # shared infrastructure and domain libraries
services/
  graph/ mcp/ pathway/ trace/ vector/
config/
  config.json  # service definitions
data/
  synthetic/   # synthetic data DSL and generated artifacts
specs/
  {feature}/   # feature specifications and plans
wiki/          # GitHub wiki (cloned on demand) — shared agent memory
design/        # design language (brand-agnostic) and brand implementations
websites/      # public site sources, one folder per site
  fit/         # forwardimpact.team
```

Git tracks `*.example.*` templates in `config/` — the live files above are
gitignored and created from examples during setup.

### Per-package layout

Every package follows the same on-disk shape (spec 390). Source files live under
`src/` — no `.js` or `.ts` files at the package root.

```
<package>/
  package.json     Required
  justfile         Per-package task runner (optional)
  src/             All source files (index.js + any domain subdirs)
  bin/             One file per declared CLI binary — thin entry points only
  config/          Checked-in configuration files (optional)
  macos/           Packaged macOS app bundle, if the package ships one (optional)
  pkg/             Packaging / distribution artifacts, non-source (optional)
  proto/           Protobuf source files (optional)
  schema/          Published schemas (JSON Schema, SHACL, etc.) (optional)
  starter/         Starter data that installs to a consumer's data dir (optional)
  supabase/        Supabase edge project (optional)
  templates/       Template files consumed at runtime (optional)
  test/            Test files
```

Subcommand handlers live under `src/commands/`, helpers under `src/lib/`.
Published `exports` point at `src/` — consumers import via subpath aliases
resolved by the `exports` map. No build step, no root-level proxy file.

### Services — the one exception

Services keep `index.js` and `server.js` at the package root (loaded by fixed
path from `config/config.example.json`), plus `proto/`, `src/`, `test/`, and
`package.json`. No `bin/` directory, no `src/index.js`.

### `.claude/` — agent configuration

`Edit` and `Write` are denied on `.claude/**` paths. Use
[`scripts/claude-write.sh`](.claude/agents/references/self-maintenance.md)
instead.

## Pull Request Workflow

All changes go through pull requests — never push directly to `main`.

**Always commit, push, and open a PR before finishing a task.** A local commit
on a scheduled-run ephemeral runner is lost work — the PR URL is the only valid
"done" signal. Commit alone is not finishing.

**Exception:** The release engineer may push trivial CI fixes (formatting, lint,
lock file drift) directly to `main` — limited to what `bun run check:fix` can
resolve. See
[.claude/agents/release-engineer.md](.claude/agents/release-engineer.md).

## Git Conventions

Format: `type(scope): subject`

- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `spec`
- **Scope**: package name (`map`, `libskill`, `libui`, `pathway`, `basecamp`),
  or domain area (`security`) for specs
- **Breaking**: add `!` after scope

`spec` is for new specification documents in `specs/` (e.g.
`spec(security): Supabase edge function hardening`).

### Releasing

Tag prefix matches the directory name: `libraries/libfoo` → `libfoo@v0.1.5`,
`products/pathway` → `pathway@v0.25.0`, `services/graph` → `svcgraph@v0.1.60`.

Pre-1.0 packages bump patch for any change. Post-1.0: semver (breaking=major,
feat=minor, fix/refactor=patch). The release engineer handles bumps, tagging,
and publishing — see [kata-release-review](.claude/skills/kata-release-review).

## Quality Commands

```sh
bun run check                 # Format and lint — ALL file types (run before every commit)
bun run check:fix             # Auto-fix format and lint issues
bun run test                  # Unit tests (run before every commit)
bun run test:e2e              # Playwright E2E tests (requires generated data)
bunx fit-map validate         # Validate data files
bunx fit-map validate --shacl # Validate with SHACL syntax check
```

## Security

Security policies apply to all contributors — human and agent.

- **ESLint security rules** — `eslint-plugin-security` is enabled in
  [eslint.config.js](eslint.config.js) with all active rules set to `"error"`.
  Two high-noise, low-signal rules (`detect-object-injection`,
  `detect-non-literal-fs-filename`) are turned off. To suppress a security rule
  for a verified false positive, add an inline disable with an audit
  justification:
  ```js
  // eslint-disable-next-line security/detect-unsafe-regex -- <why this is safe>
  ```
  Never use block-level or file-level disables for security rules. Each
  suppression must explain why the flagged code is safe.
- **Vulnerability audit** — `npm audit --audit-level=high` runs in CI (via
  temporary lockfile generation) and gates publish workflows.
- **CI secret scanning** — Gitleaks runs on every push and pull request via the
  `secret-scanning` job in
  [.github/workflows/check-security.yml](.github/workflows/check-security.yml).
- **GitHub Actions** — All third-party actions are pinned to SHA hashes. Use
  `Dependabot` for updates. Never change a pin to a tag.
- **Reporting** — See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Contact
  `hi.security@senzilla.io`.

## Dependency Policy

- **Prefer built-ins.** Use Node built-ins over npm (`fetch` not `undici`,
  `crypto.randomUUID()` not `uuid`); consolidate overlapping packages — one YAML
  parser, one markdown renderer.
- **Align versions.** Declare the same range across workspaces. Bun hoists
  matched versions to a single copy — don't remove a runtime dep just because it
  deduplicates.
- **No nested duplicates.** Same package at two major versions (e.g.
  `protobufjs@8` next to `@grpc/proto-loader/protobufjs@7`) is forbidden. Before
  merging a major bump, run `bun pm ls` and inspect `bun.lock` for `invalid`
  markers; close the PR if dependents lack compatible ranges.
- **Audit after changes.** Run `just audit-vulnerabilities` after adding or
  updating deps.

### Classification

Every dependency belongs in one category. Apply in order — first match wins.

- **Always needed** — imported synchronously at load time → `dependencies`
- **Backend-specific** — selected by env var, alternatives exist →
  `optionalDependencies` + dynamic `import()`
- **Feature-gated** — user opts in, core works without it →
  `optionalDependencies` + dynamic `import()`
- **Build-tool** — consumers already have it → `peerDependencies`
- **Build-time only** — `bin/` scripts or codegen only → `devDependencies`

### Optional Dependency Pattern

Backend-specific and feature-gated deps use dynamic `import()` at the call site
(never at module top), wrapped in `try/catch` that throws naming the feature,
the package, and the install command. Never silently fall back.
