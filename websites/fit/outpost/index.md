Walking into a meeting cold because context was scattered across email, Slack,
and last week's notes. Outpost assembles and maintains that context so you
arrive already oriented.

## What becomes possible

### For Empowered Engineers

Keep track of people, projects, and threads without depending on memory. Walk
into every meeting already oriented. Set it up once and it keeps working in the
background — continuous awareness without continuous effort.

- Automatic email and calendar sync from Apple Mail and Calendar
- A knowledge graph of people, organizations, projects, and topics
- AI-drafted email responses using your full context
- Meeting preparation briefings before every call
- Presentation generation and file organization on autopilot

## How Outpost Works

### Core Skills

| Skill                    | What it does                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Sync Apple Mail**      | Reads email threads from Mail.app via SQLite   |
| **Sync Apple Calendar**  | Reads upcoming events from Calendar.app        |
| **Extract Entities**     | Processes synced data into a knowledge graph   |
| **Draft Emails**         | Writes response drafts using your full context |
| **Meeting Prep**         | Creates briefings before upcoming meetings     |
| **Create Presentations** | Generates PDF slide decks from markdown        |
| **Document Collab**      | Assists with document creation and editing     |
| **Organize Files**       | Cleans up and organizes your files             |

### Prerequisites

Outpost spawns `claude` as a subprocess without loading your shell profile.
Install Claude Code via **Homebrew** (`brew install claude`) rather than the
native binary — the Homebrew install runs on Node.js, which supports
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` for enterprise CA certificates.

If your network requires a custom CA bundle, add an `env` block to
`~/.fit/outpost/scheduler.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS": "~/.config/ssl/ca-bundle.pem"
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install @forwardimpact/outpost
npx fit-outpost init ~/Documents/Team   # Initialize knowledge base
npx fit-outpost daemon                  # Start the scheduler
npx fit-outpost status                  # Check what's happening
```

### macOS Privacy & Security

Outpost agents need access to specific folders (Documents, Mail, Calendar). When
macOS prompts, grant only the folders each process needs via **System Settings >
Privacy & Security > Files & Folders**:

- **Outpost.app** — the TCC responsible process (Swift launcher)
- **node** — runs skill scripts with `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebangs
- **"2.1.72"** (or another version number) — this is the **Claude Code CLI**.
  macOS shows its version string instead of a name. Safe to grant per-folder
  access.
