title: "Authoring Agent-Aligned Engineering Standards"
description: "Turn 'good engineering' into an operational definition so evaluations start from a shared foundation instead of private mental models."
---

Two managers disagree on what "senior" means and neither can point to a written
definition — this guide walks you through defining an engineering standard in
YAML that Map validates and Pathway renders, giving the organization a shared
foundation it can trust.

## Prerequisites

Complete the Map and Pathway getting-started guides before continuing:

- [Getting Started: Map for Leadership](/docs/getting-started/leadership/map/) --
  install Map and initialize a `data/pathway/` directory with starter content.
- [Getting Started: Pathway for Leadership](/docs/getting-started/leadership/pathway/) --
  install Pathway and confirm you can preview the starter standard.

The rest of this guide assumes `npx fit-map validate` passes on the starter data
and `npx fit-pathway dev` renders it.

## How the pieces fit together

A standard is a set of YAML files that answer six questions:

| Question                          | Entity     | File                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| What career levels exist?         | Level      | `levels.yaml`            |
| What engineering specialties?     | Discipline | `disciplines/{id}.yaml`  |
| What work contexts modify roles?  | Track      | `tracks/{id}.yaml`       |
| What skill groups matter?         | Capability | `capabilities/{id}.yaml` |
| How should engineers approach it? | Behaviour  | `behaviours/{id}.yaml`   |
| What business outcomes result?    | Driver     | `drivers.yaml`           |

Skills are defined inside capability files. Every entity carries a `human:`
section for engineers, and most can include an `agent:` section for AI coding
agents. A discipline classifies skills into three tiers (`coreSkills`,
`supportingSkills`, `broadSkills`), and a level sets the baseline proficiency
expected at each tier (`core`, `supporting`, `broad`). When Pathway generates a
role, these two dimensions combine into concrete expectations.

For complete field definitions, required vs. optional fields, and ID patterns,
see the [YAML Schema Reference](/docs/reference/yaml-schema/).

## Step 1: Define levels

Levels establish the career ladder. Each level sets baseline proficiency for
skills and baseline maturity for behaviours. Start here because every other
entity references levels.

Edit `data/pathway/levels.yaml`. Each entry needs an `id`, titles for
professional and management tracks, and base expectations:

```yaml
# data/pathway/levels.yaml
- id: J040
  professionalTitle: Level I
  managementTitle: Associate
  ordinalRank: 1
  baseSkillProficiencies:
    core: foundational
    supporting: awareness
    broad: awareness
  baseBehaviourMaturity: emerging

- id: J060
  professionalTitle: Level II
  managementTitle: Manager
  ordinalRank: 2
  baseSkillProficiencies:
    core: working
    supporting: foundational
    broad: awareness
  baseBehaviourMaturity: developing
```

Base proficiencies use the five-level skill scale:

| Proficiency    | Autonomy              | Scope                    |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `awareness`    | with guidance         | team                     |
| `foundational` | with minimal guidance | team                     |
| `working`      | independently         | team                     |
| `practitioner` | lead, mentor          | area (2--5 teams)        |
| `expert`       | define, shape         | business unit / function |

Validate after editing:

```sh
npx fit-map validate
```

Expected output:

```text
Validation passed

Data Summary
  Skills       -- 20
  ...
  Levels       -- 2
```

## Step 2: Define capabilities and skills

Capabilities group related skills. When a track modifier targets a capability,
all skills in the group shift together -- they are a cohesive unit.

Create one file per capability in `data/pathway/capabilities/`:

```yaml
# data/pathway/capabilities/delivery.yaml
name: Delivery
description: Ship working software reliably.
ordinalRank: 1

skills:
  - id: task_execution
    name: Task Execution
    human:
      description: Breaking down and completing engineering work
      proficiencyDescriptions:
        awareness: Follows guidance to complete assigned tasks
        foundational: Breaks work into steps with minimal guidance
        working: Independently plans and delivers work
        practitioner: Leads delivery across multiple workstreams
        expert: Defines delivery practices that scale across the organization
```

Every skill requires a `human:` section with `description` and
`proficiencyDescriptions` at all five levels. Use the proficiency scale from
Step 1 to calibrate your descriptions -- "independently resolves incidents"
belongs at `working`; "defines incident response strategy" belongs at `expert`.

### Adding agent content to skills

To make a skill available to AI coding agents, add an `agent:` section:

```yaml
    agent:
      name: task-execution
      description: Breaking down and completing engineering tasks
      useWhen: Implementing features, fixing bugs, or completing work
      focus: Complete implementation with tests
      readChecklist:
        - Read the requirements or issue description
        - Identify affected files and dependencies
      confirmChecklist:
        - All tests pass
        - Code follows project conventions
```

Checklist items should be one action per line, starting with a verb. Skills that
cannot be automated can be marked `isHumanOnly: true`. For the full skill schema,
see the [YAML Schema Reference](/docs/reference/yaml-schema/).

## Step 3: Define disciplines

Disciplines define engineering specialties with T-shaped skill profiles. Each
discipline classifies skills from your capability files into three tiers:

- `coreSkills` -- deep expertise expected (maps to the level's `core`
  proficiency)
- `supportingSkills` -- solid competence expected (maps to `supporting`)
- `broadSkills` -- general awareness expected (maps to `broad`)

```yaml
# data/pathway/disciplines/software_engineering.yaml
specialization: Software Engineering
roleTitle: Software Engineer
isProfessional: true

validTracks:
  - null           # allow trackless (generalist)
  - platform
  - forward_deployed

coreSkills:
  - architecture_design
  - code_quality
  - full_stack_development
supportingSkills:
  - devops
  - cloud_platforms
broadSkills:
  - data_modeling
  - stakeholder_management
```

The `validTracks` array is required. Use `null` to allow a generalist
configuration with no track applied.

Optionally add `behaviourModifiers` (capped at +/-1 for disciplines) and
parallel `human:` / `agent:` sections for role summaries and agent identity.
See the [YAML Schema Reference](/docs/reference/yaml-schema/) for all
discipline fields.

## Step 4: Define tracks

Tracks are pure modifiers -- they adjust expectations based on work context, not
the role itself. "Platform Engineering" is a track; it applies modifiers to
capabilities for any discipline.

Create one file per track in `data/pathway/tracks/`:

```yaml
# data/pathway/tracks/platform.yaml
name: Platform

description: >
  Internal tooling and infrastructure focus. Builds shared
  capabilities that enable other engineering teams.

skillModifiers:
  reliability: 1
  delivery: -1
behaviourModifiers:
  systems_thinking: 1
```

Track `skillModifiers` target capability IDs (not individual skill IDs). A
modifier of `+1` raises all skills in that capability by one proficiency level;
`-1` lowers them by one. Results are clamped to the valid proficiency range.
Track `behaviourModifiers` are not capped like discipline modifiers -- they can
exceed +/-1.

### Adding agent team instructions to tracks

Tracks can carry an `agent:` section with `teamInstructions`:

```yaml
agent:
  teamInstructions: |
    # Platform Team

    ## Conventions
    - **Task runner:** just (see justfile)
    - **Package manager:** pnpm
    - **Test runner:** vitest
```

For guidance on structuring exported agent teams, see the
[Agent Teams guide](/docs/products/agent-teams/).

## Step 5: Define behaviours

Behaviours describe mindsets and approaches to work. They use a five-level
maturity scale:

| Maturity        | Description                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `emerging`      | Shows interest, needs prompting                      |
| `developing`    | Regularly applies with some guidance                 |
| `practicing`    | Consistently demonstrates in daily work              |
| `role_modeling` | Influences the team's approach, others seek them out |
| `exemplifying`  | Shapes organizational culture in this area           |

Create one file per behaviour in `data/pathway/behaviours/`:

```yaml
# data/pathway/behaviours/outcome_ownership.yaml
name: Own the Outcome
human:
  description: >
    Business outcomes trump engineering elegance. Embrace extreme
    ownership of what you build -- not just code quality, but
    business relationships, impact metrics, and end-to-end results.
  maturityDescriptions:
    emerging: >
      Takes responsibility for assigned tasks with supervision;
      follows through when reminded
    developing: >
      Owns task completion independently; makes pragmatic
      trade-offs between speed and polish
    practicing: >
      Takes end-to-end ownership of features and business outcomes
    role_modeling: >
      Drives accountability culture focused on outcomes not
      deliverables
    exemplifying: >
      Defines organizational accountability standards focused on
      business impact
```

Every behaviour requires a `human:` section with `description` and
`maturityDescriptions` at all five levels.

## Step 6: Define drivers

Drivers connect your standard to business outcomes. They link skills and
behaviours to the organizational results that effective engineering produces.

Edit `data/pathway/drivers.yaml`:

```yaml
# data/pathway/drivers.yaml
- id: clear_direction
  name: Clear Direction
  description: The degree to which developers understand their team's mission and goals
  contributingSkills:
    - stakeholder_management
    - product_thinking
  contributingBehaviours:
    - systems_thinking

- id: requirements_quality
  name: Requirements Quality
  description: How well specifications are defined for tasks and projects
  contributingSkills:
    - technical_writing
  contributingBehaviours:
    - relentless_curiosity
```

Aim for 3--7 drivers. Each needs an `id` and `name`; the links to skills and
behaviours are optional but make the standard's rationale visible.

## Step 7: Configure the standard

The `standard.yaml` file at the root of your data directory sets metadata and
display configuration:

```yaml
# data/pathway/standard.yaml
title: Acme Engineering Pathway
description: Agent-aligned engineering standard for Acme Corp
tag: acme
distribution:
  siteUrl: https://pathway.acme.com
```

Only `title` is required. The `distribution.siteUrl` is used by
`npx fit-pathway update` to download standard bundles for installation.

## Verify

Run validation and preview to confirm the standard is complete and correct.

**Validate the structure:**

```sh
npx fit-map validate
```

A passing run confirms all YAML files match the schema, all cross-references
between entities resolve (e.g., skill IDs in `coreSkills` exist in your
capability files), and proficiency levels use valid values.

**Preview in the browser:**

```sh
npx fit-pathway dev
```

Browse the local development server and verify that roles render the T-shape you
expect for each discipline.

**Generate a role to confirm derivation:**

```sh
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J060 --track=platform
```

Expected output (abbreviated):

```text
Software Engineer II — Platform

Core Skills
  architecture_design      working
  code_quality             working
  full_stack_development   working

Supporting Skills (adjusted by track)
  reliability              working (+1 from platform)
  ...
```

[YAML Schema Reference](/docs/reference/yaml-schema/).
