title: "Define a New Role"
description: "Create requirements for a new role in your engineering standard by generating a starting point from existing disciplines and tracks, then customizing it."

You need to add a new role to your engineering standard -- Pathway can generate
a starting point from your existing disciplines, levels, and tracks so you are
not writing from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Complete the
[Authoring Agent-Aligned Engineering Standards](/docs/products/authoring-standards/)
guide first. The steps below assume `npx fit-map validate` passes and your
`data/pathway/` directory contains at least one discipline, one level, and one
capability with skills.

## Step 1: Choose the building blocks

A role is a combination of three entities: a **discipline** (the engineering
specialty), a **level** (the career rung), and an optional **track** (a
work-context modifier). Before creating anything new, check what already exists.

List your disciplines:

```sh
npx fit-pathway discipline --list
```

Example output:

```text
software_engineering, Software Engineering, professional, platform|sre
data_engineering, Data Engineering, professional, platform
engineering_management, Engineering Management, management, —
```

List available tracks:

```sh
npx fit-pathway track --list
```

Example output:

```text
platform, Platform Engineering
sre, Site Reliability Engineering
```

If the new role fits an existing discipline and track, skip to
[Step 4](#step-4-generate-and-review-the-role). Otherwise, continue to create
the missing entity.

## Step 2: Create a discipline

Create a new YAML file in `data/pathway/disciplines/`. The filename is the
discipline ID in snake_case.

```yaml
# data/pathway/disciplines/site_reliability.yaml
specialization: Site Reliability Engineering
roleTitle: Site Reliability Engineer
isProfessional: true

validTracks:
  - null           # allow trackless (generalist)
  - platform

coreSkills:
  - sre_practices
  - incident_management
  - observability
supportingSkills:
  - cloud_platforms
  - change_management
broadSkills:
  - architecture_design
  - stakeholder_management
```

Required fields:

- `specialization` -- the display name (e.g., "Site Reliability Engineering")
- `roleTitle` -- the base title used in generated roles (e.g., "Site Reliability
  Engineer")
- `coreSkills` -- at least one skill ID; these map to the level's `core`
  proficiency
- `validTracks` -- which tracks this discipline allows; include `null` to permit
  a generalist (trackless) configuration

Every skill ID in `coreSkills`, `supportingSkills`, and `broadSkills` must
reference a skill that exists in your `data/pathway/capabilities/` files. Run
`npx fit-pathway skill --list` to see available IDs.

For the full set of discipline fields -- including `human:` and `agent:`
sections, `behaviourModifiers`, `minLevel`, and `hidden` -- see the
[YAML Schema Reference](/docs/reference/yaml-schema/).

## Step 3: Create a track (optional)

If the new role needs a work-context modifier that does not exist yet, create a
track file in `data/pathway/tracks/`:

```yaml
# data/pathway/tracks/security.yaml
name: Security Engineering

skillModifiers:
  reliability: 1
  delivery: -1
behaviourModifiers:
  systems_thinking: 1
```

Track `skillModifiers` target **capability IDs** (not individual skill IDs). A
modifier of `+1` raises all skills in that capability by one proficiency level;
`-1` lowers them by one. After creating the track, add its ID to the
`validTracks` array in every discipline that should support it.

## Step 4: Generate and review the role

With the discipline, level, and optional track in place, generate the role to
see the derived requirements:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job site_reliability J060
```

The output includes a behaviour profile and a skill matrix with derived
proficiencies:

```text
## Skill Matrix

| Skill | Level |
| --- | --- |
| SRE Practices | Working |
| Incident Management | Working |
| Observability | Working |
| Cloud Platforms | Foundational |
| Change Management | Foundational |
| Architecture Design | Awareness |
| Stakeholder Management | Awareness |
```

Add a track to see how modifiers shift expectations:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job site_reliability J060 --track=platform
```

The skill matrix will reflect the track's `skillModifiers` -- capabilities with
a `+1` modifier appear one proficiency level higher, and `-1` one level lower.

## Step 5: Customize and iterate

If the derived expectations do not match what the organization needs, adjust:

- **Wrong proficiency levels?** -- Move skill IDs between `coreSkills`,
  `supportingSkills`, and `broadSkills`. Core inherits the highest baseline.
- **Missing skills?** -- Add to a capability file, then reference in the
  discipline.
- **Track over- or under-corrects?** -- Adjust `skillModifiers` values.
- **Behaviour emphasis wrong?** -- Update `behaviourModifiers` on the discipline
  or track.

After each change, re-run `npx fit-map validate` to confirm the YAML is
structurally correct, then regenerate the role to check the result.

## Verify

Three checks confirm the new role is complete:

**1. Validation passes** -- `npx fit-map validate` prints `Validation passed`.

**2. The role generates with the expected shape:**

```sh
npx fit-pathway job site_reliability J060
```

Confirm the skill matrix and behaviour profile match what the organization
expects at this discipline and level.

**3. All valid combinations include the new role:**

```sh
npx fit-pathway job --list
```

```text
software_engineering  J050  —
software_engineering  J060  —
software_engineering  J060  platform
site_reliability      J060  —
site_reliability      J060  platform
```

The new discipline appears with every level it supports.
