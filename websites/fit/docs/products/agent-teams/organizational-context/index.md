title: "Give Agents Organizational Context"
description: "Keep agents aligned as your engineering standard evolves — guidance stays clear and non-conflicting without manual reconciliation."
---

You need to maintain alignment between your agents and the engineering standard
as it evolves -- without writing bespoke prompts for every task.

## Prerequisites

Complete the
[Configure Agents to Meet Your Engineering Standard](/docs/products/agent-teams/)
guide first -- this page assumes you have a working agent team generated with
`npx fit-pathway agent`.

## Understand the three-layer architecture

Pathway generates agent configurations into three layers. Each layer has a
distinct purpose, and information flows downward -- never upward.

```text
.claude/
  CLAUDE.md                       # Layer 1: Team Instructions
  agents/
    software-engineer--platform.md  # Layer 2: Agent Profile
  skills/
    architecture-design/SKILL.md    # Layer 3: Skills
    code-review/SKILL.md
```

| Layer               | File                          | Loaded by              | Contains                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Team Instructions   | `.claude/CLAUDE.md`           | Every agent, every run | Platform conventions, environment, architectural decisions |
| Agent Profile       | `.claude/agents/<name>.md`    | One agent at a time    | Identity, working style, constraints, skill index         |
| Skills              | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`   | On demand              | Procedural checklists, domain focus, tool references      |

The rules for what goes where follow from how these files are loaded:

- **Team Instructions** -- content that every agent on the project must know
  regardless of their specialization. Environment variables, repository
  conventions, deployment targets, shared architectural decisions.
- **Agent Profile** -- content that distinguishes this agent from others.
  Identity, working style derived from emphasized behaviours, constraints
  specific to the discipline and track.
- **Skills** -- step-by-step procedures an agent loads when it recognizes a
  matching situation. Each skill fires independently and should be
  self-contained within its domain.

## Place guidance in the correct layer

When you need to add organizational context, ask: "Who needs to know this?"

| Who needs it                 | Where it goes        | Example                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Every agent on the project   | Team Instructions    | "All services deploy to AWS eu-west-1"                     |
| One role specialization      | Agent Profile        | "Platform engineers own backward compatibility"            |
| Anyone doing a specific task | Skill                | "Code review follows the four-step checklist in REVIEW.md" |

Preview what Pathway generates for a given role to confirm placement:

```sh
npx fit-pathway agent software_engineering --track=platform
```

The output shows all three layers in order. Verify that the content you added
appears in the correct section.

## Avoid common anti-patterns

Three patterns cause agents to produce inconsistent output. Each stems from
violating the layer boundaries.

### Duplicated facts

The same fact stated in both team instructions and a skill file. When the fact
changes, one copy gets updated and the other does not. The agent receives
contradictory guidance depending on which file it reads first.

**Wrong** -- deployment target repeated in two layers:

```yaml
# data/pathway/tracks/platform.yaml
agent:
  teamInstructions: |
    All services deploy to AWS eu-west-1 using ECS Fargate.
```

```yaml
# data/pathway/capabilities/cloud_platforms.yaml
skills:
  - id: cloud_platforms
    agent:
      focus: |
        Deploy all services to AWS eu-west-1 using ECS Fargate.
```

**Right** -- state the fact once in `teamInstructions` and have the skill
reference it: `focus: Follow the deployment conventions defined in team
instructions.`

### Contradictory guidance

Two layers give conflicting instructions because they were written at different
times -- for example, team instructions say "use REST" while a skill says
"prefer gRPC." The agent has no way to resolve the conflict. Decide which layer
owns the decision, state it there, and remove the conflicting statement.

### Narrative in checklists

Skill checklists work because agents execute them item by item. Narrative
explanations inside checklist items dilute the signal. Put explanations in the
skill's `focus` or `instructions` field; keep checklist items imperative.

**Wrong:**

```yaml
readChecklist:
  - >-
    Review the PR description carefully. This matters because context is often
    lost between the author's intent and the reviewer's interpretation, so
    reading the description ensures alignment before reviewing code.
```

**Right:**

```yaml
readChecklist:
  - Read the PR description and confirm it states the change's intent.
```

## Update agents when the standard changes

Agent configurations are derived from your engineering standard data. When the
standard changes, regenerate the agent files to pick up those changes:

```sh
npx fit-pathway agent software_engineering --track=platform --output=.
```

Pathway overwrites `.claude/` with the latest derived configuration. Verify the
updated skill list:

```sh
npx fit-pathway agent software_engineering --track=platform --skills
```

If a skill was added to the discipline's tier arrays, it appears here. If one
was removed, it disappears. To see all available combinations:

```sh
npx fit-pathway agent --list
```

```text
se-platform software_engineering platform, Software Engineering (Platform Engineering)
se-sre software_engineering sre, Software Engineering (Site Reliability Engineering)
```

Then run the `agent` command for each combination that your project uses.

After regenerating, check three things:

1. **Team instructions are current.** Open `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and confirm the
   conventions still match your platform.
2. **No hand-edits were lost.** Regeneration overwrites generated files. Move
   hand-edits into the YAML source so they survive.
3. **Skills match the discipline.** Run
   `npx fit-pathway agent <discipline> --track=<track> --skills` and confirm.

## Verify

Your organizational context is well-structured when:

- **Each fact lives in exactly one layer.** No team instruction is duplicated in
  a skill file. No agent profile restates what team instructions already say.
- **No layer contradicts another.** Running
  `npx fit-pathway agent <discipline> --track=<track>` and reading the output
  top to bottom, every statement is consistent.
- **Checklist items are imperative and verifiable.** No narrative explanations
  inside checklist arrays.
- **Regeneration produces the expected output.** After updating the standard
  and running `npx fit-pathway agent ... --output=.`, the generated files
  reflect the change.
