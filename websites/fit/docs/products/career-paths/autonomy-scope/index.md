title: "Understand Autonomy and Scope"
description: "Understand what independence, decision-making authority, and complexity look like at your level — so scope conversations start from shared definitions."
---

You need to understand what your level's expectations mean in practice for how
independently you work, what decisions you own, and how far your influence
reaches.

## Prerequisites

Complete the
[See What's Expected at Your Level](/docs/products/career-paths/) guide first --
this page assumes you know your role coordinates (discipline, level, and
optional track) and have already run `npx fit-pathway job` at least once.

## Read the Expectations section

Generate your role definition and focus on the Expectations section:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J060
```

The Expectations section appears at the top of the output:

```text
## Expectations

- **Impact Scope**: Delivers components and features that contribute to
  team-level objectives and product outcomes.
- **Autonomy Expectation**: Works independently on defined deliverables,
  escalating ambiguous issues to senior engineers.
- **Influence Scope**: Influences technical decisions within the immediate
  team through reasoned contributions.
- **Complexity Handled**: Handles moderately complex problems with several
  known variables and documented precedents.
```

Each expectation describes a different dimension of your role:

| Expectation              | What it answers                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact Scope**         | How large is the blast radius of your work?              |
| **Autonomy Expectation** | How much direction do you need, and from whom?           |
| **Influence Scope**      | Whose technical decisions can you shape?                 |
| **Complexity Handled**   | How ambiguous and multi-variable are your problems?      |

Replace `software_engineering J060` with your own discipline and level to see
the expectations that apply to your role.

## Compare expectations across levels

The `progress` command shows which skills and behaviours change between levels,
but it does not show how expectations shift. To see that, generate the role
definition at two levels and compare the Expectations sections side by side.

Generate your current level and the next one:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J060
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J070
```

Here is what the Expectations section looks like at each of those levels:

**Engineer (J060):**

```text
- **Impact Scope**: Delivers components and features that contribute to
  team-level objectives and product outcomes.
- **Autonomy Expectation**: Works independently on defined deliverables,
  escalating ambiguous issues to senior engineers.
- **Influence Scope**: Influences technical decisions within the immediate
  team through reasoned contributions.
- **Complexity Handled**: Handles moderately complex problems with several
  known variables and documented precedents.
```

**Senior Engineer (J070):**

```text
- **Impact Scope**: Drives outcomes that span an entire team or product area,
  including cross-functional dependencies.
- **Autonomy Expectation**: Operates autonomously across the full delivery
  lifecycle, setting direction for assigned scope.
- **Influence Scope**: Influences technical strategy within the team and is a
  trusted voice in adjacent teams.
- **Complexity Handled**: Handles complex, ambiguous problems requiring
  trade-off analysis across quality, compliance, and timelines.
```

Reading these side by side reveals the concrete shifts. Moving from J060 to
J070, impact scope grows from team-level components to spanning an entire
product area. Autonomy shifts from working independently on defined
deliverables to setting direction across the full delivery lifecycle. Influence
extends beyond the immediate team into adjacent teams. Complexity moves from
"moderately complex with known variables" to "ambiguous problems requiring
trade-off analysis."

If your role includes a track, add the `--track` flag to both commands to see
how specialization affects expectations:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J060 --track=platform
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J070 --track=platform
```

## Connect expectations to skill and behaviour changes

Expectation shifts do not happen in isolation -- they are supported by
corresponding changes in skills and behaviours. Use the `progress` command to
see those changes:

```sh
npx fit-pathway progress software_engineering J060
```

```text
# Career Progression

**From**: Engineer Software Engineer
**To**: Senior Engineer Software Engineer

## Summary

- Skills to improve: 7
- Behaviours to improve: 5
- New skills: 0
- Total changes: 12
```

Each skill and behaviour change in the progression output maps to one or more
expectation shifts. For example, Architecture Design growing from Working to
Practitioner supports the broader impact scope ("spans an entire team or product
area"). The Think in Systems behaviour maturing from Practicing to Role Modeling
supports handling "ambiguous problems requiring trade-off analysis."

When reviewing your progression, ask for each expectation shift: which skill or
behaviour changes make that shift possible?

## View the full expectations ladder

To see how expectations evolve across the entire career ladder, generate role
definitions at multiple levels:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J040
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J060
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J070
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J080
```

Read only the Expectations section from each output. The progression tells a
story:

| Level | Autonomy pattern                              | Impact pattern                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| J040  | works under close direction with regular review | discrete tasks within a single team    |
| J060  | works independently on defined deliverables     | components and features for team goals |
| J070  | operates autonomously, sets direction           | spans an entire team or product area   |
| J080  | defines goals with minimal oversight            | shapes outcomes across multiple teams  |

This table is a summary for illustration -- your organization's standard may
use different wording. Always read the actual output of `npx fit-pathway job`
for the authoritative definition.

## Verify

You have reached the outcome of this guide when you can answer these questions
from your Pathway output:

- **What does your level expect for independence?** You can describe your
  autonomy expectation in concrete terms -- not "I should be independent" but
  the specific scope and boundaries of that independence.
- **How far does your influence reach?** You can name the boundary -- immediate
  team, adjacent teams, department, or organization -- and what "influence"
  means at that boundary.
- **What complexity are you expected to handle?** You can describe the type of
  problems your level owns, including how much ambiguity is expected.
- **What changes at the next level?** You have compared expectations across two
  levels and can name the specific shifts in each dimension.
- **Which skills support those shifts?** You have connected at least one
  expectation change to the skill or behaviour growth that enables it.

If any of these are unclear, re-run `npx fit-pathway job <discipline> <level>`
at two adjacent levels and compare the Expectations sections.
