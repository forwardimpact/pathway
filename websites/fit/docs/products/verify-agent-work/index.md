title: "Verify Agent Work Against Your Standard"
description: "When agent output looks right but violates an organizational convention only visible in the standard data, use Guide and Pathway to review by exception instead of reading every line."
---

An engineer approved agent output without reviewing it against the standard --
the code looked correct, but it violated an organizational convention that was
only visible in the standard data. Reviewing every line negates the productivity
gain of using agents. This guide walks you through verifying agent work against
your organization's actual engineering standard so you can review by exception,
not by default. Two products work together: **Pathway** makes the role's
expected skills, behaviours, and conventions visible so you know what to look
for, and **Guide** reviews specific deliverables against those expectations.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have completed the setup for both products:

- [Getting Started: Pathway for Engineers](/docs/getting-started/engineers/pathway/)
  -- install Pathway, initialize a `data/pathway/` directory with your
  organization's standard data or the starter content.
- [Getting Started: Guide for Engineers](/docs/getting-started/engineers/guide/)
  -- install Guide, run codegen, authenticate with Anthropic, process your
  standard data, and start the service stack.

You should also know the role coordinates (discipline, level, and track) for
the agent that produced the work. If you have not identified those yet, work
through [See What's Expected at Your Level](/docs/products/career-paths/) first
-- that guide covers finding role coordinates and understanding what each level
expects.

## See what the standard expects for this role

Before reviewing agent output, make the quality bar explicit. Pathway derives
the full expectation profile for any role from your organization's standard
data -- it is not a generic checklist.

Generate the role definition for the discipline and level the agent is
configured to work at. For example, if the agent operates as a Software
Engineer (J060) on a platform track:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J060 --track=platform
```

The output has four sections:

1. **Expectations** -- the level's impact scope, autonomy, influence, and
   complexity.
2. **Behaviour Profile** -- each behaviour the organization values and the
   maturity expected at this level.
3. **Skill Matrix** -- every skill relevant to the discipline and track, with
   the proficiency level expected.
4. **Driver Coverage** -- how the skill and behaviour profile maps to
   engineering effectiveness drivers.

Here is what the Expectations section looks like:

```text
## Expectations

- **Impact Scope**: Delivers components and features that contribute to
  team-level objectives and product outcomes.
- **Autonomy Expectation**: Works independently on defined deliverables,
  escalating ambiguous issues to senior engineers.
- **Influence Scope**: Influences technical decisions within the immediate
  team through reasoned contributions.
- **Complexity Handled**: Handles moderately complex problems with several
  known variables and documented precedents.
```

The Skill Matrix is the most useful section for output review. It lists every
skill the role requires and the proficiency level expected at each one. An agent
configured for this role should produce output consistent with `working`-level
Architecture Design, `working`-level Code Quality, and so on. When a skill
shows `foundational` or `awareness`, the standard expects less depth in that
area -- and you should calibrate your review accordingly.

### Inspect specific skills the output touches

If the agent's deliverable involves architecture decisions, inspect the skill
definition to see what the expected proficiency level looks like in practice:

```sh
npx fit-pathway skill architecture_design
```

```text
# Architecture Design

Scale

Designs system structures that meet functional, scalability, and regulatory
requirements. Balances modularity, integration, and validated computer system
constraints typical of pharmaceutical environments.

## Level Descriptions

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Awareness | You recognize common architectural styles... |
| Foundational | You implement components inside a defined architecture... |
| Working | You design services and module boundaries for a bounded domain... |
| Practitioner | You lead architecture for a product or platform area... |
| Expert | You define architectural strategy and reference patterns... |
```

Each proficiency level describes concrete, observable actions. Compare the
level description for the agent's expected proficiency against what the agent
actually produced. If the role expects `working`-level Architecture Design, the
output should show evidence of designing services and module boundaries for a
bounded domain -- not just implementing components inside someone else's
architecture (which is `foundational`).

Repeat for each skill the deliverable touches. The Skill Matrix tells you which
skills are relevant; the skill detail tells you what the expected proficiency
looks like.

### Check behaviour expectations

Agent output can be technically correct but violate how the organization
expects work to be approached. Behaviours describe those expectations.

If the agent was supposed to demonstrate systems thinking in its design, check
what the standard expects:

```sh
npx fit-pathway behaviour systems_thinking
```

```text
# Think in Systems

## Maturity Levels

| Maturity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Emerging | You recognise that your work connects to broader processes... |
| Developing | You actively trace dependencies beyond your immediate scope... |
| Practicing | You consistently reason about systems end-to-end... |
| Role Modeling | You shape how teams approach problems... |
| Exemplifying | You set the standard for systems thinking... |
```

If the role expects `developing`-level systems thinking, the output should
actively trace dependencies beyond the immediate scope. An agent that solves
the problem in isolation -- without considering upstream or downstream effects
-- has produced output that violates the behaviour expectation, even if the
code itself works.

## Review the deliverable with Guide

You now know what the standard expects. Guide applies that knowledge to a
specific deliverable. Instead of reading every line yourself, describe the
output to Guide and ask it to evaluate against the standard.

Start Guide and describe what the agent produced. Lines starting with `>` are
prompts you type inside the Guide session:

```sh
npx fit-guide
```

```text
> I'm reviewing a PR from an agent configured as a J060 Software Engineer on
> the platform track. The PR introduces a new service for processing webhook
> events. Does this align with what our standard expects at working-level
> architecture design?
```

Guide responds with an evaluation grounded in your organization's skill
definitions:

```text
At working-level Architecture Design, your standard expects the engineer to
design services and module boundaries for a bounded domain. For a webhook
processing service, I'd look for:

1. **Clear service boundary** — The service should have a well-defined API
   contract. Check whether the PR documents what events it handles and what
   it delegates to other services.

2. **Module boundaries within the service** — Internal structure should
   separate concerns (event parsing, validation, routing, handlers). If
   everything lives in a single file or handler, that's below working level.

3. **Integration points documented** — Working-level architecture means the
   engineer considers how this service connects to the broader system. Look
   for documentation of dependencies, data flow, and failure modes.

Your standard does not expect a J060 to lead architecture for the platform
area (that's practitioner level) — so the scope should be bounded to this
service, not a platform-wide webhook strategy.
```

Guide tells you what to check and what is out of scope for this level. Instead
of reviewing every line, you review the specific areas Guide identifies.

### Ask about specific concerns

When something in the output looks off, ask Guide whether it violates the
standard:

```text
> The PR doesn't handle retry logic for failed webhook deliveries. Is that
> expected at J060 on the platform track?
```

```text
> The agent used a synchronous request pattern instead of an event queue.
> Does our standard say anything about that at working level?
```

Guide checks each question against the skill definitions, behaviour
expectations, and conventions in your standard. Two engineers asking the same
question get the same foundational answer because the source of truth is
shared.

### Pipe a focused question

For a quick check without entering the interactive session, pipe a question
directly:

```sh
echo "Does our standard expect working-level code review to catch cross-cutting concerns?" | npx fit-guide
```

Guide will reference the specific markers from your capability YAML and return
a grounded answer.

## Build a review checklist from the standard

For recurring review scenarios -- such as reviewing all agent PRs for a
specific service -- use Pathway to build a reusable checklist grounded in the
standard.

Generate the skill IDs relevant to the agent's role:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J060 --track=platform --skills
```

```text
architecture_design
code_quality
full_stack_development
cloud_platforms
sre_practices
change_management
incident_management
observability
performance_optimization
data_modeling
stakeholder_management
```

Each skill ID maps to a set of concrete expectations in your standard. For the
skills most relevant to the deliverable type (e.g., `architecture_design` and
`code_quality` for a new service PR), look up the proficiency descriptions:

```sh
npx fit-pathway skill code_quality
```

The proficiency description at the expected level becomes a checklist item. For
example, if `working`-level Code Quality says "writes clean, well-structured
code with consistent style and meaningful naming," that is what you verify in
the agent's output -- and everything else is noise you can skip.

## Verify

You have reached the outcome of this guide when you can answer these questions:

- **What does the standard expect for this role?** You have generated the role
  definition with `npx fit-pathway job` and can name the skills, proficiency
  levels, and behaviour maturities relevant to the deliverable.
- **What does each expected proficiency look like in practice?** You have
  inspected at least one skill with `npx fit-pathway skill` and can describe
  the concrete actions the expected proficiency level involves.
- **Can you articulate what to check and what to skip?** You have asked Guide
  to evaluate the deliverable and received specific areas to review, grounded
  in the standard.
- **Are you reviewing by exception?** Instead of reading every line, you are
  checking the areas Guide identified as relevant to the role's expectations --
  and skipping areas where the output meets or exceeds the standard.

If any of these are unclear, revisit the relevant step. The shift from "review
everything" to "review by exception" happens when you trust the standard to
define the quality bar and Guide to apply it.
