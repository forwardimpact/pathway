The **Kata Agent Team** is an autonomous and continuously improving agentic
development team running on GitHub Actions, organized as a daily
**Plan-Do-Study-Act** (PDSA) cycle. Agents plan by writing specs, do by
shipping features and hardening the repo, study their own execution traces and
outputs, and act on findings — closing the loop every day. The name follows
Toyota Kata: agents grasp the current condition (via prior-run traces),
establish target conditions (via specs), and experiment toward them (via
implementation). Six agent personas, eight workflows, eighteen skills form this
cycle.

This page is the internal-contributor entry point. The canonical reference is
[`KATA.md`](https://github.com/forwardimpact/monorepo/blob/main/KATA.md) at the
repo root — read by every agent at the start of every Kata run. This page
renders that material under the
[Kata brand](https://github.com/forwardimpact/monorepo/blob/main/design/kata/index.md)
for human contributors.

## The Six Personas

<div class="grid">

<a class="product-card" href="#staff-engineer">

### Staff Engineer

The drafting bench. Owns the full **spec → design → plan → implement** arc for
approved specs. Plan and Do.

</a>

<a class="product-card" href="#release-engineer">

### Release Engineer

The shipping bay. Keeps PR branches merge-ready, repairs trivial CI, cuts
releases. Do.

</a>

<a class="product-card" href="#security-engineer">

### Security Engineer

The night watch. Patches dependencies, hardens supply chain, enforces security
policies. Do, Study, Act.

</a>

<a class="product-card" href="#product-manager">

### Product Manager

The merge gate. Triages issues and PRs, merges fix/bug/spec PRs, runs
evaluations. The sole external merge point. Do, Study, Act.

</a>

<a class="product-card" href="#technical-writer">

### Technical Writer

The archivist's desk. Reviews docs for accuracy, curates wiki, fixes staleness,
files spec gaps. Study, Act.

</a>

<a class="product-card" href="#improvement-coach">

### Improvement Coach

The Ohno circle. Facilitates storyboard meetings and 1-on-1 coaching sessions.
Reads traces. Study.

</a>

## The PDSA Loop

Every workflow belongs to a phase of the **Plan-Do-Study-Act** cycle (after
Deming). Findings from Study always re-enter the loop as specs or fix PRs —
nothing is observed without downstream action.

- **Plan** — Turn approved `spec.md` (WHAT/WHY) into `design.md` (WHICH/WHERE)
  then `plan-a.md` (HOW/WHEN) with steps, files, sequencing, risks.
- **Do** — Execute plans via implementation PRs; run scheduled workflows that
  harden, release, and maintain. Every run captures a trace.
- **Study** — Analyze Do outputs across four streams: security audits, external
  feedback triage, one-topic-deep doc review, one-trace-deep grounded theory.
- **Act** — Trivial findings become **pushed fix PRs**; structural findings
  become `spec.md` documents on **pushed spec branches**. A local commit is not
  a PR — the URL is the only valid completion signal. `fix/` and `spec/`
  branches never mix.

## The Trust Boundary

The Product Manager is the **sole external merge point**. All other merge paths
operate on trusted sources (our agents, Dependabot).

| External PR type | What merges                     | Who implements                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `fix` / `bug`    | Contributor's code (small)      | The external contributor              |
| `spec`           | Specification document only     | Trusted agents, never the contributor |
| Everything else  | Nothing — requires human review | N/A                                   |

Top-7 contributors pass the trust gate; `kata-agent-team` PRs are trusted by
identity. A compromised top contributor cannot inject code via this pipeline —
specs merge only the document, not code.

## The Workflows

Seven scheduled workflows run on a three-shift Europe/Paris rhythm — **night**
by 07:00, **storyboard** at 08:00, **day** by 15:00, **swing** by 23:00 — plus
an event-driven **agent-react** workflow on PR and discussion activity.

| Workflow                    | Schedule (Paris, CEST)                | Agent                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **kata-storyboard**         | Daily 08:00                           | improvement-coach (facilitates 5 agents) |
| **kata-coaching**           | `workflow_dispatch`                   | improvement-coach (facilitates 1 agent)  |
| **agent-product-manager**   | Night 03:23 · Day 12:17 · Swing 20:17 | product-manager                          |
| **agent-staff-engineer**    | Night 04:11 · Day 13:11 · Swing 21:11 | staff-engineer                           |
| **agent-security-engineer** | Night 04:53                           | security-engineer                        |
| **agent-technical-writer**  | Night 05:37                           | technical-writer                         |
| **agent-release-engineer**  | Night 06:23 · Day 14:23 · Swing 22:23 | release-engineer                         |
| **agent-react**      | On PR/discussion activity             | product-manager (facilitates 4 agents)   |

Each shift forms a **producer → reviewer → shipper** chain: the product manager
triages and merges so staff has a fresh backlog, staff implements, release
ships. The night shift slots security-engineer and technical-writer between
staff and release.

## Coordination Channels

Five channels carry agent-to-agent and agent-to-human collaboration,
distinguished by **time horizon** and **persistence**.

| Channel               | Use for                                                          | Lifetime                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Wiki**              | Permanent curated memory: summaries, weekly logs, decisions      | Persistent                      |
| **Storyboard**        | Daily current condition and next experiment                      | One day; captured into wiki     |
| **Discussion**        | Open questions before they become decisions — RFCs, cross-policy | Until resolved into spec / wiki |
| **PR / issue thread** | Real-time response on a specific artifact                        | Lives with the artifact         |
| **Sub-agent**         | Specialized inline work within one run                           | Ephemeral (one task)            |

Per-output coordination is governed by
[coordination-protocol.md](https://github.com/forwardimpact/monorepo/blob/main/.claude/agents/references/coordination-protocol.md);
shared memory mechanics by
[memory-protocol.md](https://github.com/forwardimpact/monorepo/blob/main/.claude/agents/references/memory-protocol.md).

## Metrics

Agents record time-series data to `wiki/metrics/{agent}/{domain}/{YYYY}.csv`
after each run. The `kata-metrics` skill defines the CSV schema (six fields:
date, metric, value, unit, run, note), storage convention, and metric design.
The storyboard meeting answers "what is the actual condition now?" with numbers,
not narratives, and XmR process behavior charts distinguish stable processes
from special-cause reactions.

---

## Authentication

Workflows authenticate via the **GitHub App** `kata-agent-team`, not a PAT.
Each run generates a 1-hour installation token via
`actions/create-github-app-token` — no long-lived secrets to rotate. The token
must generate before `actions/checkout` so checkout-token writes trigger
downstream workflows.

| Permission    | Why                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contents      | Checkout, commit, push to `fix/`, `spec/`, release branches       |
| Pull requests | Open, comment, merge PRs (release-engineer, product-manager)      |
| Issues        | Triage, label, comment (product-manager)                          |
| Discussions   | Reply on discussions and discussion comments (agent-react) |
| Workflows     | Token-driven pushes re-trigger downstream workflows               |
| Metadata      | Required by GitHub                                                |
