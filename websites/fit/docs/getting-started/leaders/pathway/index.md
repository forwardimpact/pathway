Pathway is your interface to the agent-aligned engineering standard — browse
roles, generate job definitions, and preview everything in the browser.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- Standard data initialized (see
  [Getting Started: Map for Leaders](/docs/getting-started/leaders/map/))

## Install

```sh
npm install @forwardimpact/pathway
```

## Preview

Start the development server to see your agent-aligned engineering standard in
the browser:

```sh
npx fit-pathway dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

Browse disciplines, levels, and skills to verify everything looks correct.

## Generate job definitions

Generate a complete job definition by combining a discipline, level, and
optional track:

```sh
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J060 --track=platform
```

## Generate interview questions

Create role-specific interview question sets:

```sh
npx fit-pathway interview software_engineering J060
```
