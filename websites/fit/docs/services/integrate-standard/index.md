title: Query the Engineering Standard from Any Product
description: Products that access derived roles and profiles without embedding derivation logic — shared pathway gRPC service.
---

You are building a product feature that needs career paths, skill matrices, or
agent profiles derived from the engineering standard. The derivation logic --
modifier resolution, proficiency clamping, tier classification, track
specialization -- lives in `@forwardimpact/libskill`, and you do not want to
embed that library in every product. The pathway gRPC service runs the
derivation on a shared backend and returns Turtle RDF over a typed interface.
Your product sends a discipline, level, and optional track; the service returns
the full derived role or agent profile.

This guide walks through connecting to the pathway service, calling its RPCs,
and verifying the responses contain the derived data your feature needs.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Generated client code available (run `npx fit-codegen --all` if not)
- Services running (`npx fit-rc start` or `just guide`)
- Standard data initialized at `data/pathway/`. If you have not done that yet,
  run `npx fit-pathway init` and follow the prompts.

Install the transport and type packages:

```sh
npm install @forwardimpact/librpc @forwardimpact/libtype
```

## Architecture overview

The pathway service is a thin gRPC transport over `@forwardimpact/libskill`.
It loads the standard data once at startup, then serves derivation requests
from any connected product. Products get derived data without importing the
derivation library or loading YAML files themselves.

```text
Product A ──┐                     ┌── data/pathway/disciplines/
            ├── gRPC ── pathway ──┼── data/pathway/levels.yaml
Product B ──┘                     ├── data/pathway/tracks/
                                  ├── data/pathway/capabilities/
                                  └── data/pathway/behaviours/
```

The service exposes six RPCs:

| RPC                    | Purpose                                                    | Request type                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `ListJobs`             | Enumerate all valid discipline/level/track combinations    | `pathway.ListJobsRequest`             |
| `DescribeJob`          | Derive a full role at a specific coordinate                | `pathway.DescribeJobRequest`          |
| `ListAgentProfiles`    | Enumerate all valid discipline/track combinations          | `pathway.ListAgentProfilesRequest`    |
| `DescribeAgentProfile` | Derive an agent profile for a discipline and track         | `pathway.DescribeAgentProfileRequest` |
| `DescribeProgression`  | Compute the delta between two levels                       | `pathway.DescribeProgressionRequest`  |
| `ListJobSoftware`      | Derive the software toolkit for a role                     | `pathway.ListJobSoftwareRequest`      |

All RPCs return `tool.ToolCallResult` with a `content` field containing Turtle
RDF.

## Connect to the pathway service

Create a pathway client using the generated `PathwayClient` class:

```js
import { createClient, createTracer } from "@forwardimpact/librpc";
import { createLogger } from "@forwardimpact/libtelemetry";

const logger = createLogger("my-product");
const tracer = await createTracer("my-product");

const pathwayClient = await createClient("pathway", logger, tracer);
```

`createClient("pathway")` resolves the host and port from `config/config.json`,
creates a `PathwayClient` instance, and establishes the gRPC channel with
automatic retry.

## List all valid roles

Enumerate every valid discipline/level/track combination in the standard:

```js
import { pathway } from "@forwardimpact/libtype";

const request = pathway.ListJobsRequest.fromObject({});
const result = await pathwayClient.ListJobs(request);
console.log(result.content.substring(0, 300));
```

The response is a Turtle RDF string listing each valid role. To filter by
discipline:

```js
const request = pathway.ListJobsRequest.fromObject({
  discipline: "software_engineering",
});

const result = await pathwayClient.ListJobs(request);
```

## Describe a specific role

Derive the full role definition -- skill matrix, behaviour profile,
responsibilities, expectations -- for a discipline, level, and optional track:

```js
const request = pathway.DescribeJobRequest.fromObject({
  discipline: "software_engineering",
  level: "J070",
  track: "platform",
});

const result = await pathwayClient.DescribeJob(request);
console.log(result.content.substring(0, 500));
```

Expected output (Turtle RDF, abbreviated):

```text
@prefix fit: <https://www.forwardimpact.team/schema/rdf/> .
@prefix schema: <https://schema.org/> .

<urn:fit:job:software_engineering:J070:platform> a fit:Job ;
  schema:title "Senior Engineer Software Engineer - Platform Engineering" ;
  fit:discipline "software_engineering" ;
  fit:level "J070" ;
  fit:track "platform" ;
  fit:skillCount 16 ;
  fit:behaviourCount 5 .
```

The Turtle content includes the full skill matrix, behaviour profile, and
derived responsibilities. Parse it as RDF or extract fields with string
matching, depending on your product's needs.

### Invalid combinations

If the combination is not valid (for example, a discipline that requires a
track but is called without one), the service returns a gRPC error:

```js
try {
  const request = pathway.DescribeJobRequest.fromObject({
    discipline: "software_engineering",
    level: "J070",
    // no track -- may be invalid depending on your standard
  });
  await pathwayClient.DescribeJob(request);
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Invalid combination:", err.message);
}
```

## Describe an agent profile

Agent profiles follow the same derivation path as roles but apply
agent-specific policies: human-only skills are excluded, only the
highest-proficiency skills are kept, and skills and behaviours are sorted by
strength descending. To derive one:

```js
const request = pathway.DescribeAgentProfileRequest.fromObject({
  discipline: "software_engineering",
  track: "platform",
});

const result = await pathwayClient.DescribeAgentProfile(request);
console.log(result.content.substring(0, 500));
```

The `track` field is required for agent profiles. The level is derived
automatically (the service uses the reference level for the standard).

## Analyze career progression

Compute the delta between two levels to see which skills and behaviours change:

```js
const request = pathway.DescribeProgressionRequest.fromObject({
  discipline: "software_engineering",
  from_level: "J060",
  to_level: "J070",
  track: "platform",
});

const result = await pathwayClient.DescribeProgression(request);
console.log(result.content.substring(0, 500));
```

The response describes which skills gain proficiency levels, which behaviours
gain maturity levels, and what new responsibilities appear at the target level.

## List the software toolkit

Derive the software tools expected for a role based on its skill matrix:

```js
const request = pathway.ListJobSoftwareRequest.fromObject({
  discipline: "software_engineering",
  level: "J070",
  track: "platform",
});

const result = await pathwayClient.ListJobSoftware(request);
console.log(result.content.substring(0, 300));
```

The response is Turtle RDF listing each software tool, its category, and the
skills that reference it.

## Verify

You have reached the outcome of this guide when:

- `createClient("pathway")` connects without error.
- `ListJobs` returns Turtle RDF listing all valid role combinations.
- `DescribeJob` returns a full role definition for a given discipline, level,
  and track.
- `DescribeAgentProfile` returns an agent-optimized profile for a discipline
  and track.
- `DescribeProgression` returns the delta between two levels.
- Invalid combinations produce a gRPC error, not a silent empty response.

If any connection fails, confirm the services are running with
`npx fit-rc status` and check that `config/config.json` lists the correct host
and port for the pathway service.
