title: Turn Standard Definitions into Queryable Data
description: Turn engineering standard definitions into queryable, derivable data with @forwardimpact/libskill -- load YAML once, derive skill matrices, behaviour profiles, and agent configurations programmatically.
---

You are building a feature that needs skill matrices or role definitions, and
the standard data sits in YAML files across `data/pathway/`. Parsing those files
yourself means reimplementing derivation rules -- modifier resolution,
proficiency clamping, tier classification, validation -- and keeping your code
in sync as the standard evolves. `@forwardimpact/libskill` handles that
derivation. Load the standard data once with `@forwardimpact/map`, then call
pure functions that return structured skill matrices, behaviour profiles,
responsibilities, and agent configurations. The library applies the same rules
that `fit-pathway` uses internally, so your feature stays consistent with the CLI.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Install both packages:

```sh
npm install @forwardimpact/libskill @forwardimpact/map
```

- Standard data initialized at `data/pathway/`. If you have not done that yet,
  run `npx fit-pathway init` and follow the prompts.

## Load the standard data

`@forwardimpact/map` provides a `DataLoader` that reads every YAML file in your
standard data directory and returns a single object with all entities resolved:

```js
import { createDataLoader } from "@forwardimpact/map/loader";

const loader = createDataLoader();
const data = await loader.loadAllData("data/pathway");
```

The returned `data` object contains arrays for `disciplines`, `levels`,
`tracks`, `skills`, `behaviours`, `capabilities`, and `drivers`. Every function
in `@forwardimpact/libskill` accepts these arrays as input parameters. The
library never reads the filesystem itself -- you control where data comes from,
and the functions remain pure.

## Derive a skill matrix

A skill matrix shows every skill relevant to a discipline at a specific level,
with the proficiency that level requires. Call `deriveSkillMatrix` with a
discipline, level, and optionally a track:

```js
import { deriveSkillMatrix } from "@forwardimpact/libskill";

const discipline = data.disciplines.find((d) => d.id === "software_engineering");
const level = data.levels.find((l) => l.id === "J070");

const matrix = deriveSkillMatrix({
  discipline,
  level,
  skills: data.skills,
  capabilities: data.capabilities,
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(matrix[0], null, 2));
```

Expected output (one entry):

```json
{
  "skillId": "architecture_design",
  "skillName": "Architecture Design",
  "capability": "design",
  "capabilityRank": 1,
  "isHumanOnly": false,
  "type": "core",
  "proficiency": "practitioner",
  "proficiencyDescription": "You lead architecture for a product or platform area..."
}
```

Each entry in the matrix includes:

| Field                    | Meaning                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `skillId`                | unique identifier matching the YAML source         |
| `type`                   | `core`, `supporting`, `broad`, or `track`          |
| `proficiency`            | derived proficiency after applying modifiers        |
| `proficiencyDescription` | human-readable description of that proficiency      |
| `isHumanOnly`            | `true` for skills irrelevant to agents             |

The matrix is sorted by type (core first, then supporting, broad, track) and
alphabetically within each type.

## Apply track specializations

Tracks adjust skill proficiencies and add track-specific skills via modifiers.
Pass a track to see the difference:

```js
const track = data.tracks.find((t) => t.id === "platform");

const generalMatrix = deriveSkillMatrix({
  discipline,
  level,
  skills: data.skills,
  capabilities: data.capabilities,
});

const platformMatrix = deriveSkillMatrix({
  discipline,
  level,
  track,
  skills: data.skills,
  capabilities: data.capabilities,
});

console.log("General skills:", generalMatrix.length);
console.log("Platform skills:", platformMatrix.length);
```

Expected output:

```text
General skills: 12
Platform skills: 16
```

The platform track adds skills like Change Management, Incident Management,
Observability, and Performance Optimization that do not appear in the generalist
matrix. Skills that were already present may also shift proficiency -- a track
modifier of `+1` on a capability raises every skill in that capability by one
proficiency level (clamped to the level's maximum).

## Derive a behaviour profile

Behaviours describe how engineers approach their work. The behaviour profile
shows the expected maturity for each behaviour at a given level:

```js
import { deriveBehaviourProfile } from "@forwardimpact/libskill";

const profile = deriveBehaviourProfile({
  discipline,
  level,
  behaviours: data.behaviours,
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(profile[0], null, 2));
```

Expected output (one entry):

```json
{
  "behaviourId": "systems_thinking",
  "behaviourName": "Think in Systems",
  "maturity": "role_modeling",
  "maturityDescription": "You shape how teams approach problems..."
}
```

Track and discipline modifiers both affect behaviour maturity. A discipline with
`behaviourModifiers: { collaboration: 1 }` raises the collaboration maturity by
one level from the base. Adding a track with its own modifier stacks on top.

## Derive a complete role definition

When you need the full picture -- skill matrix, behaviour profile,
responsibilities, expectations -- use `deriveJob`. It validates the combination
first and returns `null` for invalid pairings (for example, a discipline that
requires a track but is called without one):

```js
import { deriveJob } from "@forwardimpact/libskill";

const result = deriveJob({
  discipline,
  level,
  track,
  skills: data.skills,
  behaviours: data.behaviours,
  capabilities: data.capabilities,
});

if (!result) {
  console.error("Invalid combination");
  process.exit(1);
}

console.log(result.title);
console.log("Skills:", result.skillMatrix.length);
console.log("Behaviours:", result.behaviourProfile.length);
console.log("Responsibilities:", result.derivedResponsibilities.length);
```

Expected output:

```text
Senior Engineer Software Engineer - Platform Engineering
Skills: 16
Behaviours: 5
Responsibilities: 4
```

The returned object contains `id`, `title`, `skillMatrix` (same shape as
`deriveSkillMatrix` output), `behaviourProfile` (same shape as
`deriveBehaviourProfile`), `derivedResponsibilities`, and `expectations`
(scope, autonomy, influence, complexity).

## Generate all valid roles

To enumerate every valid discipline-level-track combination, use
`generateAllJobs`:

```js
import { generateAllJobs } from "@forwardimpact/libskill";

const allJobs = generateAllJobs({
  disciplines: data.disciplines,
  levels: data.levels,
  tracks: data.tracks,
  skills: data.skills,
  behaviours: data.behaviours,
});

console.log("Total valid roles:", allJobs.length);
console.log(
  "Titles:",
  allJobs.slice(0, 3).map((j) => j.title)
);
```

Expected output (values depend on your standard):

```text
Total valid roles: 48
Titles: [
  "Associate Engineer Clinical Informatics",
  "Associate Engineer Data Engineer",
  "Associate Engineer Software Engineer"
]
```

The function skips invalid combinations automatically. Each entry is a full role
definition (same shape as `deriveJob` output).

## Prepare display-ready views

When you need data shaped for a UI or report rather than raw derivation output,
use the view preparation functions. `prepareJobDetail` adds driver coverage
analysis and a de-duplicated toolkit on top of the base derivation:

```js
import { prepareJobDetail } from "@forwardimpact/libskill";

const view = prepareJobDetail({
  discipline,
  level,
  track,
  skills: data.skills,
  behaviours: data.behaviours,
  drivers: data.drivers,
  capabilities: data.capabilities,
});

console.log(view.title);
console.log("Driver coverage:");
for (const d of view.driverCoverage) {
  console.log(`  ${d.name}: ${(d.coverage * 100).toFixed(0)}%`);
}
```

Expected output:

```text
Senior Engineer Software Engineer - Platform Engineering
Driver coverage:
  Velocity: 85%
  Stability: 70%
```

For list views, `prepareJobSummary` returns only the title, counts, and
identifiers -- no full matrices.

## Derive agent profiles

Agent profiles follow the same derivation path as role definitions but apply
additional policies: human-only skills are excluded, only the highest-level
skills are kept, and skills and behaviours are sorted by level descending.

Use `prepareAgentProfile` when you need the filtered, agent-optimized view:

```js
import { prepareAgentProfile } from "@forwardimpact/libskill/profile";

const agentProfile = prepareAgentProfile({
  discipline,
  track,
  level,
  skills: data.skills,
  behaviours: data.behaviours,
  capabilities: data.capabilities,
});

console.log("Agent skills:", agentProfile.skillMatrix.length);
console.log("First skill:", agentProfile.skillMatrix[0].skillName);
```

The agent skill matrix is smaller than the full role matrix because human-only
skills are removed and lower-level duplicates are collapsed. Behaviours are
sorted strongest-first -- useful for agent instructions where the most important
working styles should lead. For the full agent generation pipeline (identity
text, working styles, skill markdown), see `generateAgentProfile` on the
`@forwardimpact/libskill/agent` subpath.

## Subpath imports

The root import provides the most commonly used functions. For focused use,
import from subpaths to load only what you need:

| Subpath                                   | Key exports                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@forwardimpact/libskill`                 | `deriveSkillMatrix`, `deriveBehaviourProfile`, `deriveJob`|
| `@forwardimpact/libskill/matching`        | `calculateJobMatch`, `findMatchingJobs`                   |
| `@forwardimpact/libskill/progression`     | `analyzeProgression`, `analyzeLevelProgression`           |
| `@forwardimpact/libskill/agent`           | `generateAgentProfile`, `deriveAgentSkills`               |
| `@forwardimpact/libskill/profile`         | `prepareBaseProfile`, `prepareAgentProfile`               |
| `@forwardimpact/libskill/interview`       | `deriveInterviewQuestions`                                |
| `@forwardimpact/libskill/job`             | `prepareJobDetail`, `prepareJobSummary`                   |
| `@forwardimpact/libskill/job-cache`       | `createJobCache`, `buildJobKey`                           |
| `@forwardimpact/libskill/policies`        | filtering, sorting, and predicate policies                |

## Cache derived roles

When you derive the same combination repeatedly (for example, in a loop
comparing roles), pass a cache to avoid redundant computation:

```js
import { createJobCache } from "@forwardimpact/libskill/job-cache";
import { prepareJobDetail } from "@forwardimpact/libskill";

const cache = createJobCache();

const view = prepareJobDetail({
  discipline, level, track,
  skills: data.skills, behaviours: data.behaviours,
  drivers: data.drivers, capabilities: data.capabilities,
  jobCache: cache,
});
```

The cache keys on discipline ID, level ID, and track ID. Create one cache per
request or operation; do not share caches across data reloads.

## Validate combinations before deriving

Not every discipline-level-track triple is valid. Some disciplines require a
track; some tracks have a minimum level. Check before deriving:

```js
import { isValidJobCombination } from "@forwardimpact/libskill";

const valid = isValidJobCombination({ discipline, level, track: null });
console.log("Valid without track:", valid);
```

If the discipline has `validTracks: [null, "platform"]`, calling without a track
is valid. If it has `validTracks: ["platform", "sre"]` (no `null`), a track is
required and the call returns `false`.

`deriveJob` calls this validation internally and returns `null` for invalid
combinations. Use `isValidJobCombination` when you need to check validity
without performing the full derivation -- for example, to disable invalid
options in a form.

## Verify

You have reached the outcome of this guide when:

- You can load standard data with `createDataLoader().loadAllData()` and pass
  the result to `@forwardimpact/libskill` functions.
- You can derive a skill matrix for a discipline + level (+ optional track) and
  inspect the type, proficiency, and description of each entry.
- You can derive a behaviour profile and read the maturity level for each
  behaviour.
- You can generate a complete role definition with `deriveJob` and access its
  skill matrix, behaviour profile, responsibilities, and expectations.
- You understand how track modifiers shift proficiencies and maturities.
