title: Give Agents Typed, Retrievable Knowledge
description: Set up knowledge infrastructure so agents can answer relationship questions, look up context, and find related content -- using libresource, libgraph, libindex, and libvector without external engines.
---

You need agents that can answer questions about relationships between entities,
look up context by identifier, and find semantically related content. Right now,
the knowledge is either trapped in untyped files or requires an external search
engine to retrieve. Four libraries -- `@forwardimpact/libresource`,
`@forwardimpact/libgraph`, `@forwardimpact/libindex`, and
`@forwardimpact/libvector` -- give you a self-contained knowledge infrastructure
that runs locally without external databases.

The pipeline flows in three stages: ingest HTML into typed resources, extract RDF
triples into a graph, and generate vector embeddings for semantic retrieval. Each
stage produces a JSONL-backed index that agents can query directly.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An embedding endpoint (any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` API) for
  vector indexing
- HTML files with [schema.org](https://schema.org/) microdata markup in a
  `data/knowledge/` directory

Install all four libraries:

```sh
npm install @forwardimpact/libresource @forwardimpact/libgraph @forwardimpact/libindex @forwardimpact/libvector
```

## How the pipeline fits together

Each library owns one stage. The output of one stage feeds the next:

```text
data/knowledge/*.html
        |
        v
  libresource          -->  data/resources/*.json     (typed resources)
        |
        +-------+
        |       |
        v       v
  libgraph    libvector
        |       |
        v       v
  data/graphs/  data/vectors/
  index.jsonl   index.jsonl
  ontology.ttl
```

`libindex` provides the `IndexBase` class that both `GraphIndex` and
`VectorIndex` extend. It handles JSONL persistence, lazy loading, prefix
filtering, and token budgeting so the specialized indexes inherit that
behavior without reimplementing it.

## 1. Prepare the knowledge directory

Create `data/knowledge/` and add HTML files with schema.org microdata. The
resource processor extracts typed entities from `itemscope` / `itemtype` /
`itemprop` attributes:

```html
<!-- data/knowledge/team.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><base href="https://example.com/team" /></head>
<body>
  <div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
    <span itemprop="name">Alice Chen</span>
    <span itemprop="jobTitle">Senior Engineer</span>
    <link itemprop="worksFor" href="https://example.com/org/acme" />
  </div>
  <div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization">
    <meta itemprop="url" content="https://example.com/org/acme" />
    <span itemprop="name">Acme Corp</span>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

The `<base href>` element sets the IRI for all relative references in the
document. Without it, the processor falls back to the `--base` flag or a
default URI.

## 2. Ingest HTML into typed resources

Run the resource processor to parse every HTML file in `data/knowledge/` and
store each entity as a typed `Message` resource:

```sh
npx fit-process-resources --base=https://example.com/
```

The processor:

1. Finds all `.html` files in `data/knowledge/`
2. Sanitizes the DOM (normalizes whitespace, encodes stray characters)
3. Extracts RDF quads from microdata using the streaming parser
4. Skolemizes blank nodes into content-hashed URIs for cross-document
   deduplication
5. Serializes each entity's triples as Turtle RDF
6. Stores the result in `data/resources/` as a JSON file with a
   content-hashed identifier

When the same entity appears in multiple HTML files, the processor merges
triples using RDF union semantics -- new properties are added, existing
identical triples are deduplicated.

After processing, verify the resources exist:

```sh
ls data/resources/
```

```text
common.Message.a1b2c3d4.json
common.Message.e5f6g7h8.json
```

Each file contains the entity's typed identifier, its role (`system`), and the
RDF content as a Turtle string.

## 3. Build the RDF graph

With resources in place, extract their RDF content into a graph index and
generate the ontology:

```sh
npx fit-process-graphs
```

The graph processor:

1. Reads all resource identifiers from `data/resources/`
2. Filters to `common.Message` resources (which contain RDF content)
3. Parses each resource's Turtle content back into quads
4. Adds quads to the in-memory N3 triple store, keyed by resource identifier
5. Writes the graph index to `data/graphs/index.jsonl`
6. Builds a SHACL ontology from all observed types and predicates
7. Writes the ontology to `data/graphs/ontology.ttl`

The ontology file describes the shape of the data -- which types exist, what
properties each type has, and how types relate to each other. Agents read this
file to understand what questions the graph can answer before writing queries.

Verify the graph was built:

```sh
npx fit-subjects
```

```text
https://example.com/team#alice	https://schema.org/Person
https://example.com/org/acme	https://schema.org/Organization
```

Each line shows a subject URI and its type. Run a triple-pattern query to test
a relationship:

```sh
npx fit-query "?" schema:worksFor "?"
```

```text
common.Message.a1b2c3d4
```

The output is the resource identifier containing the matching triple. The
query uses the `subject predicate object` pattern where `?` is a wildcard.
Prefixed names like `schema:worksFor` expand using the standard prefix map
(`schema:` -> `https://schema.org/`).

## 4. Generate vector embeddings

The vector processor takes each resource's text content, sends it to an
embedding endpoint, and stores the resulting vectors:

```sh
npx fit-process-vectors
```

This requires an OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint. Configure the endpoint
and token through environment variables or `config/vectors.yaml`:

```yaml
# config/vectors.yaml
embeddingBaseUrl: http://localhost:8080
```

The processor:

1. Reads all resource identifiers from `data/resources/`
2. Filters out conversations and tool functions
3. Batches resource content for efficient embedding API calls
4. Stores each vector alongside its resource identifier in
   `data/vectors/index.jsonl`

After processing, test a semantic search:

```sh
npx fit-search "senior engineering role"
```

```text
common.Message.a1b2c3d4	0.8712
common.Message.e5f6g7h8	0.6543
```

Results are ranked by dot-product score (cosine similarity for normalized
vectors). Higher scores indicate closer semantic matches.

## 5. Query from code

The CLIs are thin wrappers around the library APIs. For programmatic access,
use the libraries directly:

```js
import { createGraphIndex, parseGraphQuery } from "@forwardimpact/libgraph";
import { createResourceIndex } from "@forwardimpact/libresource";

// Query the graph for all Person entities
const graph = createGraphIndex("graphs");
const pattern = parseGraphQuery("? rdf:type schema:Person");
const identifiers = await graph.queryItems(pattern);

// Resolve matched identifiers to full resources
const resources = createResourceIndex("resources");
const items = await resources.get(identifiers.map(String));

for (const item of items) {
  console.log(item.id.type, item.id.name);
  console.log(item.content);   // Turtle RDF string
}
```

The `createGraphIndex("graphs")` call reads from `data/graphs/`; the
`createResourceIndex("resources")` call reads from `data/resources/`. Both use
the `data/<prefix>/` convention. Pass a different prefix to point at a
different directory.

For vector search from code:

```js
import { VectorIndex } from "@forwardimpact/libvector/index/vector.js";
import { createStorage } from "@forwardimpact/libstorage";

const storage = createStorage("vectors");
const vectorIndex = new VectorIndex(storage);

// Assume you have a query vector from your embedding API
const queryVector = [0.12, -0.34, 0.56, /* ... */];
const results = await vectorIndex.queryItems([queryVector], {
  limit: 5,
  threshold: 0.5,
});

for (const id of results) {
  console.log(String(id), id.score?.toFixed(4));
}
```

Both `queryItems` methods accept a filter object with `prefix`, `limit`, and
`max_tokens` to scope results by identifier prefix, cap the count, or stay
within a token budget.

## Verify

After running all three stages, confirm the full pipeline produced the expected
artifacts:

```sh
ls data/resources/       # Typed resource JSON files
ls data/graphs/          # index.jsonl + ontology.ttl
ls data/vectors/         # index.jsonl with embeddings

npx fit-subjects                           # All subjects and types
npx fit-query "?" rdf:type schema:Person   # Graph query
npx fit-search "team member"               # Semantic search
```

Each command should return results drawn from the HTML files you ingested. If a
command returns nothing, check that the previous stage completed: resources must
exist before graphs, and resources must exist before vectors.

## What's next

Each query mode has a dedicated guide for deeper work:

- [Query the Graph](/docs/libraries/ground-agents/query-graph/) -- write
  triple-pattern queries, filter by type, and traverse relationships in the
  RDF graph.
- [Look Up Context](/docs/libraries/ground-agents/lookup-context/) -- retrieve
  resources by identifier, apply prefix filters, and manage token budgets with
  the index API.
- [Resolve a Resource](/docs/libraries/ground-agents/resolve-resource/) -- load
  a typed resource by identifier with access control and inspect its content
  and metadata.
- [Search Semantically](/docs/libraries/ground-agents/search-semantically/) --
  embed a query, score against the vector index, and rank results by
  relevance.
