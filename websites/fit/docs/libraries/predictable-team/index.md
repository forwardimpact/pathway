title: Persistent Memory for Agent Teams
description: Set up wiki-backed memory for an agent team, record metrics with XmR control charts, and verify that agents act on real changes instead of noise.
---

Your agents finish a session, and their findings disappear. The next session
starts from scratch -- no continuity, no accumulated evidence, no way to tell
whether yesterday's change made anything better. `fit-wiki` and `fit-xmr` work
together to solve this: the wiki gives agents durable shared memory, and XmR
charts turn that memory into a signal the team can trust.

This guide walks through the full arc -- from bootstrapping the wiki through
recording metrics, charting them, and embedding live charts into a storyboard
that updates itself.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A GitHub repository with a wiki enabled (Settings > Features > Wikis)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` set in the environment (for wiki clone/sync)
- Agent profiles defined under `.claude/agents/` (one `.md` file per agent)
- Skills defined under `.claude/skills/` (one `kata-*` directory per skill)

## Step 1: Bootstrap the wiki

Initialize the wiki working tree from your repository root:

```sh
npx fit-wiki init
```

```
init: wiki ready at wiki
```

This clones the repository's GitHub wiki into `wiki/` and creates a
`wiki/metrics/<skill>/` directory for every `kata-*` skill found under
`.claude/skills/`. The wiki URL is derived from the repository's `origin`
remote.

The command is idempotent -- running it again on an already-initialized wiki
changes nothing. It authenticates using ambient GitHub credentials.

After initialization, the directory structure looks like this:

```
wiki/
  Home.md
  MEMORY.md
  metrics/
    kata-documentation/
    kata-security-audit/
    kata-spec/
    ...
```

Each `metrics/<skill>/` directory is where that skill's observations accumulate
over time.

## Step 2: Set up agent summary files

Each agent needs a summary file in `wiki/` with a message inbox marker so
teammates can send memos. Create one per agent:

```markdown
<!-- wiki/staff-engineer.md -->
# Staff Engineer

## Message Inbox

<!-- memo:inbox -->

## Summary

Last run: (none)
```

The `<!-- memo:inbox -->` marker is invisible in rendered markdown but required
by `fit-wiki memo`. Without it, the memo command exits with code 2 and a
diagnostic. Place the marker once; do not remove it.

## Step 3: Record observations to CSV

As agents run, they record measured observations to the CSV file for their
skill. The `fit-xmr record` command handles the file lifecycle -- it creates the
directory and CSV header if they do not exist:

```sh
npx fit-xmr record --skill kata-spec --metric findings_count --value 3 --unit count
```

```
metric=findings_count n=1 status=insufficient_data latest=3
```

The one-line summary confirms the row was appended and shows the current sample
size and classification. With only one data point, the status is
`insufficient_data` -- XmR limits require at least 15 observations.

The CSV lands at `wiki/metrics/kata-spec/2026.csv` (year derived from the
recording date) with the standard header:

```csv
date,metric,value,unit,run,note
2026-05-04,findings_count,3,count,,
```

### Recording with full context

Add a run identifier and a contextual note:

```sh
npx fit-xmr record \
  --skill kata-security-audit \
  --metric findings_count \
  --value 5 \
  --unit count \
  --run "https://github.com/org/repo/actions/runs/12345" \
  --note "new dependency audit rule"
```

The `run` field links back to the CI run or session that produced the
observation. The `note` field captures what you learned -- it is the durable
record of context that numbers alone cannot convey.

### CSV schema

| Field    | Required | Description                                                          |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `date`   | yes      | ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Sort key.                                   |
| `metric` | yes      | Metric name. One CSV may carry multiple metrics; they are grouped.   |
| `value`  | yes      | Numeric. Non-numeric values are rejected by `validate`.              |
| `unit`   | yes      | Free text (`count`, `days`, `pct`, ...). Empty is rejected.          |
| `run`    | no       | URL or identifier of the run that produced this observation.         |
| `note`   | no       | Free text. Record what you discovered when a signal appears.         |

Validate the file at any time:

```sh
npx fit-xmr validate wiki/metrics/kata-spec/2026.csv
```

A zero exit code means the file matches the schema.

## Step 4: Analyze the metrics

Once a metric has at least 15 observations, `fit-xmr` computes natural process
limits and applies Wheeler's three detection rules. Run the analysis:

```sh
npx fit-xmr analyze wiki/metrics/kata-spec/2026.csv --metric findings_count
```

The output includes the 14-line XmR chart, the computed limits, and a
classification. For structured output that scripts and agents can parse:

```sh
npx fit-xmr analyze wiki/metrics/kata-spec/2026.csv --metric findings_count --format json
```

```json
{
  "metric": "findings_count",
  "n": 18,
  "status": "predictable",
  "classification": "stable",
  "latest": { "date": "2026-05-04", "value": 3, "mr": 1 },
  "stats": { "mu": 4.2, "UPL": 12.5, "LPL": 0, "URL": 7.5 }
}
```

Read `classification` first:

| Classification | Meaning                              | What to do                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stable`       | No rules activated. Predictable.     | Leave it alone. Intervening makes things worse.                     |
| `signals`      | At least one X-chart rule activated.  | Investigate what changed.                                           |
| `chaos`        | mR Rule 1 activated. Variation is unstable. | Investigate the outsized moves before trusting any limits.    |
| `insufficient` | Fewer than 15 points.                | Keep recording.                                                     |

The limits come from the data itself -- no external targets needed. Do not set
goals based on these limits. They describe what the process does, not what it
should do.

classification, see [XmR Analysis](/docs/libraries/predictable-team/xmr-analysis/).

## Step 5: Embed live charts in the storyboard

A storyboard is a monthly markdown file in `wiki/` that tracks the team's
metrics, obstacles, and experiments. Create one for the current month:

```markdown
<!-- wiki/storyboard-2026-M05.md -->
# Storyboard -- 2026-M05

## Metrics

### findings_count (kata-spec)

<!-- xmr:findings_count:wiki/metrics/kata-spec/2026.csv -->
<!-- /xmr -->

### cycle_time (kata-implement)

<!-- xmr:cycle_time:wiki/metrics/kata-implement/2026.csv -->
<!-- /xmr -->

## Obstacles

(none yet)

## Experiments

(none yet)
```

Each XmR block is a marker pair: the opening comment names the metric and the
CSV path; the closing comment marks the end of the region that gets replaced.

Regenerate all charts in the storyboard:

```sh
npx fit-wiki refresh
```

Without a path argument, this targets the current month's storyboard at
`wiki/storyboard-YYYY-MNN.md`. To refresh a specific file:

```sh
npx fit-wiki refresh wiki/storyboard-2026-M05.md
```

After refresh, each block contains the latest value, status, chart, and signal
summary:

```markdown
<!-- xmr:findings_count:wiki/metrics/kata-spec/2026.csv -->
**Latest:** 3 · **Status:** predictable

```
 UPL 12.5 ──────────────────────────────────────────────
          |
+1.5s 9.4 |        .           .  .              .
    m 6.4 +---------------------------------------------
-1.5s 3.4 |  .  .     .  .  .        .     .  .     .  .
          |
  LPL 0.3 ──────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Signals:** --
<!-- /xmr -->
```

The operation is idempotent -- running it twice produces the same output. Files
without markers are left unchanged.

## Step 6: Sync the wiki

The wiki is a separate git repository. Two commands keep it synchronized with
the remote:

```sh
npx fit-wiki pull
```

```
pull: up to date
```

```sh
npx fit-wiki push
```

```
push: committed and pushed
```

`push` is a no-op when no local changes exist. On conflicts, local state wins --
the most recent session's observations take precedence. `pull` exits non-zero
with a diagnostic when a conflict is detected.

Both commands work well as hooks in your agent workflow: `pull` at session start
to pick up changes from other agents, `push` at session end to persist your
own.

## Step 7: Send memos between agents

When one agent discovers something another agent should see on its next run, a
memo delivers the message:

```sh
npx fit-wiki memo --from technical-writer --to staff-engineer --message "findings_count shifted after spec-590 landed"
```

```
wrote wiki/staff-engineer.md
```

The message appears in the target agent's `## Message Inbox` section:

```markdown
- 2026-05-04 from **technical-writer**: findings_count shifted after spec-590 landed
```

Newest memos appear first. To reach every agent except yourself:

```sh
npx fit-wiki memo --from technical-writer --to all --message "storyboard refreshed with new baseline"
```

## Verify

Confirm the full memory system is working by running through this checklist:

1. **Wiki exists.** The `wiki/` directory contains a `.git` subdirectory.

   ```sh
   git -C wiki rev-parse --git-dir
   ```

   Expected: `.git`

2. **Metrics directories exist.** One per `kata-*` skill.

   ```sh
   ls wiki/metrics/
   ```

   Expected: one directory per skill (e.g., `kata-spec/`, `kata-documentation/`).

3. **CSV validates.** At least one CSV passes schema validation.

   ```sh
   npx fit-xmr validate wiki/metrics/kata-spec/2026.csv
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0.

4. **Analysis runs.** If 15+ observations exist, the classification is not
   `insufficient`.

   ```sh
   npx fit-xmr analyze wiki/metrics/kata-spec/2026.csv --format json
   ```

   Expected: `"classification"` is `"stable"`, `"signals"`, or `"chaos"`.

5. **Storyboard refreshes.** Charts regenerate without errors.

   ```sh
   npx fit-wiki refresh
   ```

   Expected: no stderr output.

6. **Sync round-trips.** Changes can be pushed and pulled.

   ```sh
   npx fit-wiki push && npx fit-wiki pull
   ```

   Expected: `push: committed and pushed` (or `nothing to push`) and
   `pull: up to date`.

7. **Memos land.** A test memo appears in the target's inbox.

   ```sh
   npx fit-wiki memo --from test --to staff-engineer --message "verify memo delivery"
   ```

   Expected: `wrote wiki/staff-engineer.md`.

## What's next

This guide covered the end-to-end setup: bootstrapping the wiki, recording
observations, charting them, embedding charts in a storyboard, and keeping
everything in sync. From here:

- [Wiki Operations](/docs/libraries/predictable-team/wiki-operations/) -- bounded tasks for
  sending memos, refreshing charts, and syncing state when the wiki is already
  set up.
- [XmR Analysis](/docs/libraries/predictable-team/xmr-analysis/) -- deeper coverage of signal
  rules, chart anatomy, and how to respond when a metric shifts.
