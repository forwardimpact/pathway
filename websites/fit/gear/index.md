Platform builders composing agentic products need focused, interoperable
libraries and services — not monolithic frameworks. Gear provides individual
capabilities that work standalone or together, with humans and agents sharing
the same interface and documentation.

## What becomes possible

### For Platform Builders

Give humans and agents shared capabilities through the same interface, with
tooling to prove changes actually improved outcomes. Every CLI prints
grep-friendly help and JSON output; every library ships a matching skill in the
`forwardimpact/fit-skills` pack so agents land on the same docs as humans.

33 libraries and 5 services, all published to npm under
`@forwardimpact/lib*` and `@forwardimpact/svc*`. Browse the full tables in
[libraries/README.md](https://github.com/forwardimpact/monorepo/blob/main/libraries/README.md)
and
[services/README.md](https://github.com/forwardimpact/monorepo/blob/main/services/README.md).

### Enable Agents on Every Surface

Give agents and humans the same interface so capabilities ship once. Render
structured output across web and terminal from shared handler logic.

### Ground Agents in Context

Answer relationship questions, look up context fast, and give agents typed,
retrievable knowledge with semantic search — no external database required.

</a>

### Integrate with the Engineering Standard

Turn engineering standard YAML into queryable, derivable data — skill matrices,
agent profiles, and job definitions without parsing by hand.

</a>

### Keep Service Contracts Typed

Keep types in sync with proto definitions, register gRPC services as MCP tools
from config, and ship endpoints without reimplementing transport.

</a>

### Keep Services Running and Visible

Manage service lifecycle from one interface, keep services recoverable without
manual intervention, and make operations observable.

</a>

### Prove Agent Changes

Prove whether agent changes improved outcomes with reproducible evidence.
Produce complete eval datasets from a single DSL file.
