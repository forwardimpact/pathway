![Map](/assets/icon-map.svg)

### Map

Chart the territory. Define your engineering standard in plain text — skills,
behaviours, and levels the whole organization trusts.

</a>

<a class="product-card" href="/pathway/">

![Pathway](/assets/icon-pathway.svg)

### Pathway

Navigate the trail. See what's expected at every level and generate job
definitions, career paths, and agent profiles from one shared standard.

</a>

<a class="product-card" href="/guide/">

![Guide](/assets/icon-guide.svg)

### Guide

Find your bearing. Career guidance and output review grounded in your
organization's actual engineering standard — not generic advice.

<a class="product-card" href="/landmark/">

![Landmark](/assets/icon-landmark.svg)

### Landmark

Check the cairn. Show engineering progress without making individuals feel
surveilled — evidence, trends, and engineer voice.

</a>

<a class="product-card" href="/summit/">

![Summit](/assets/icon-summit.svg)

### Summit

Reach the peak. See whether a team has the capability to deliver — coverage,
risks, and what-if scenarios before making a staffing decision.

</a>

<a class="product-card" href="/outpost/">

![Outpost](/assets/icon-outpost.svg)

### Outpost

Set up camp. Walk into every meeting already oriented — scheduled AI tasks
assemble your context and keep your knowledge organized.

### Gear

Carry the right gear. Shared libraries and services for platform builders and
agents — CLIs, retrieval, evaluation, and infrastructure published to npm and
the `forwardimpact/fit-skills` skill pack.

Forward Impact Engineering puts this into practice. Engineering leaders define
what great engineering looks like. Engineers see exactly what's expected, find
growth areas with real evidence, and walk into every day prepared. Leaders
measure progress and staff teams without blaming individuals or relying on
guesswork. When expectations are clear and progress is visible, engineers
deliver with confidence and pride.

## Get Started

### For Engineering Leaders

Define and publish an agent-aligned engineering standard for your team:

```sh
npx fit-pathway build --url=https://pathway.myorg.com
```

### For Empowered Engineers

Install the CLI and explore what's available:

```sh
npx fit-pathway skill --list        # Browse all skills
npx fit-pathway job software_engineering J060          # Generate a job definition
npx fit-outpost init ~/Documents/Team                 # Set up your personal ops center
```

### For Platform Builders and Agents

Generate aligned agent profiles and install the shared skill pack:

```sh
npx fit-pathway agent software_engineering --track=platform  # Generate agent profiles
npx skills add forwardimpact/fit-skills                      # Install the skill pack
```
