# Source Classification

Reference for `extract-entities` Step 1.

## Type detection

- `Meeting:` / `Attendees:` / `Transcript:` headers → **meeting** (creates
  notes).
- `From:` and `To:` or `Subject:` → **email** (updates only).
- `**Platform:** Microsoft Teams` → **teams chat** (updates only).
- File in `Voice Memos/` → **voice memo** (creates notes).
- File in `apple_calendar/` → **calendar event** (enriches existing notes only).
- Ad-hoc document (from `~/Desktop/`, `~/Downloads/`, or another skill passing
  the path) → **document** (creates notes — meeting rules).

## Always process — never skip

Calendar events. Internal-only meetings still enrich Project and Topic notes
(decisions, agenda items). Only skip all-day placeholders with no attendees and
no description (e.g. "Block", "OOO").

## Skip entirely

- Newsletters (unsubscribe links, "View in browser", bulk-sender indicators).
- Marketing emails (promotional language, no-reply senders).
- Automated notifications (GitHub, Jira, Slack, CI/CD, shipping).
- Spam / cold outreach with no existing relationship.
- Product-update emails, release notes, changelogs.
- Social-media notifications.
- Receipts and order confirmations.
- Calendar-invite emails that are just logistics.
- Mass emails (many recipients, mailing-list headers).

## Process — update existing notes only

- Emails from people already in `knowledge/People/`.
- Emails referencing existing projects or organizations.

## Process — can create new notes

- Meeting transcripts with external attendees.
- Voice memos.
- Ad-hoc documents.

## Warm-intro exception

If an email is a warm introduction from someone with a note, and they introduce
a new person, **create** a note for the introduced person.

Signals: subject contains "Intro:", "Introduction:", "Meet", "Connecting"; body
contains "introduce you to", "want to connect", "meet [Name]"; new person is
CC'd.

## Self-exclusion

Never create or update notes for the user (matches name, email, or @domain from
`USER.md`) or for `@{user.domain}` colleagues.
