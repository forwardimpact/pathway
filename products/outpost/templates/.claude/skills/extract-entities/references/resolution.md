# Entity Resolution

Reference for `extract-entities` Steps 2b–5.

## Name-variant collection

Extract every way each entity is referenced.

- **People:** full names, first / last names, initials, email addresses,
  roles/titles, pronouns with clear antecedents.
- **Organizations:** full names, short names, abbreviations, email domains.
- **Projects:** explicit names, descriptive references ("the pilot", "the
  deal").
- **Goals:** references to time-bound targets, OKRs, or measurable outcomes that
  match `knowledge/Goals/` entries.
- **Priorities:** references to strategic directions that match
  `knowledge/Priorities/` entries.

## Matching

| Source has               | Note has                 | Match if                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| First name "Sarah"       | Full name "Sarah Chen"   | Same organization context |
| Email "sarah@acme.com"   | Email field              | Exact match               |
| Email domain "@acme.com" | Organization "Acme Corp" | Domain matches org        |
| Any variant              | Aliases field            | Listed in aliases         |

## Disambiguation priority

Email match > Organization context > Role match > Aliases > Recency.

If still ambiguous, **skip** rather than guess.

## "Would I prep for this person?" — Step 5

Apply for entities not resolved to existing notes (meetings only).

**Create a note for:**

- Decision makers or key contacts at customers, prospects, partners.
- Investors or potential investors.
- Candidates being interviewed.
- Advisors or mentors with ongoing relationships.
- Introducers who connect you to valuable contacts.

**Do not create notes for:**

- Transactional service providers (bank employees, support reps).
- One-time administrative contacts.
- Large-group attendees you didn't interact with.
- Assistants handling only logistics.

People who don't get their own note go in the Organization note's `## Contacts`
section instead.

## Role inference

When role isn't explicit, infer from context and qualify with the basis:

- Organizer of a cross-company meeting → likely senior or partnerships.
- Technical questions → likely engineering.
- Pricing questions → likely procurement or finance.
- "I'll need to check with my team" → manager.
- "I can make that call" → decision maker.

Format: `**Role:** Product Lead (inferred from evaluation discussions)`.

## Never auto-create

`Goals/` and `Priorities/`. Link to existing entries when referenced; update
progress / backlinks; never create new ones from extracted content.
