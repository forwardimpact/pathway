`- Requisition export processed on {today}: {N} candidates` to Notes.

## Existing-candidate edits

Apply targeted edits to `brief.md` — never rewrite. Set/update `Req`, advance
`Status` if the Workday step is more advanced, update `Last activity`, append
`**{Date Applied}**: Applied to {Req ID} — {Title} via {Source}` to Pipeline,
fill only missing Email/Phone/ Location. Never overwrite richer existing data
with sparser Workday data.
