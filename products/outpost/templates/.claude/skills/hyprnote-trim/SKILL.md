description: Trim a Hyprnote transcript to its logical end. Recordings are often left running after a meeting finishes — this skill finds the natural conclusion (goodbyes, sign-offs) and cuts the transcript there. Use when the user asks to trim, cut, or clean up a Hyprnote transcript.

# Trim Transcript

Find the logical end of a Hyprnote meeting transcript and trim everything after
it. Meetings recorded with Hyprnote often have trailing noise — the mic stays on
after goodbyes, capturing ambient sound, unrelated chatter, or silence. This
skill identifies the natural conclusion and edits the transcript in place.

## Trigger

Run this skill:

- When the user asks to trim, cut, or clean up a Hyprnote transcript
- When given a specific session ID to trim
- When another skill (e.g., hyprnote-process) flags a transcript as having
  excessive trailing content

## Prerequisites

- Hyprnote installed with session data at
  `~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/sessions/`

## Inputs

- **Session ID** — a UUID identifying the Hyprnote session to trim
- `~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/sessions/{uuid}/transcript.json` — the
  word-level transcript

## Outputs

- `~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/sessions/{uuid}/transcript.json` —
  edited in place with words after the logical end removed
- `~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/sessions/{uuid}/audio.mp3` — deleted.
  Trimming indicates the recording captured audio beyond the consented meeting,
  so the full audio must be removed to respect participant privacy.
- Printed summary: original duration, trim point, new duration, words removed

## Steps

### Step 0 — Validate the session

1. Confirm the session directory exists:
   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/sessions/{uuid}/
   ```
2. Confirm `transcript.json` exists and has at least one transcript with words.
3. Read `_meta.json` to get the session title for context.

### Step 1 — Reconstruct readable text

Convert the word-level transcript into readable text with timestamps. Group
words into lines by speaker channel and approximate sentence boundaries. The
goal is a human-readable view you can analyze for the logical end.

Use this approach:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env bun
import json

data = json.load(open('transcript.json'))
words = data['transcripts'][0]['words']

# Reconstruct text grouped by ~30-second windows with channel labels
current_min = -1
for i, w in enumerate(words):
    minute_mark = int(w['start_ms'] / 30000)  # 30-second buckets
    if minute_mark != current_min:
        current_min = minute_mark
        mins = w['start_ms'] / 60000
        print(f'\n[{mins:.1f}m ch{w["channel"]}]', end='')
    print(w['text'], end='')
```

### Step 2 — Identify the logical end

Read through the reconstructed text and find the **first point where the meeting
has clearly concluded**. Look for these signals, roughly in order of strength:

**Strong ending signals (any one is sufficient):**

- Explicit farewells: "bye", "bye bye", "goodbye", "take care", "have a good
  day/evening/weekend", "cheers"
- Final thank-yous followed by no substantive content: "thank you so much",
  "thanks a lot", "thanks everyone"
- Meeting close phrases: "that's all", "we're done", "let's wrap up", "I'll let
  you go"

**Supporting signals (strengthen the case but not sufficient alone):**

- Long silence gaps (>30 seconds) after a farewell exchange
- Channel drops — only one speaker remains after goodbyes
- Shift to clearly unrelated content (ambient noise transcribed as fragments)
- Filler-only content: repeated "um", "uh", fragments with no meaning

**The trim point** is the end of the last meaningful farewell exchange. Include
the final "bye" / "thank you" / "take care" from both parties if present, then
cut everything after.

### Step 3 — Confirm with the user

Before modifying the file, show the user:

1. The **session title** and **original duration**
2. The **last ~20 words before the proposed trim point** (as readable text)
3. The **first ~20 words after the proposed trim point** (what will be removed)
4. The **new duration** and **number of words being removed**

Wait for the user to approve before proceeding.

### Step 4 — Trim the transcript

Once approved:

1. Read the current `transcript.json` (fresh read, not cached).
2. Slice the words array at the identified index.
3. Write the modified JSON back to `transcript.json`.

```python
import json

path = f'~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/sessions/{uuid}/transcript.json'
data = json.load(open(path))
data['transcripts'][0]['words'] = data['transcripts'][0]['words'][:trim_index]
json.dump(data, open(path, 'w'), indent=2)
```

4. Print a summary:
   ```
   Trimmed: {title}
     Before: {original_words} words, {original_duration}
     After:  {new_words} words, {new_duration}
     Removed: {removed_words} words ({removed_duration} of trailing content)
   ```

### Step 5 — Delete the audio recording

The fact that a transcript needs trimming means the recording captured audio
beyond the consented meeting — ambient conversation, unrelated chatter, or other
people who did not consent to being recorded. The full audio file must be
deleted to respect participant privacy.

1. Delete the audio file:
   ```bash
   rm "~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/sessions/{uuid}/audio.mp3"
   ```
2. Confirm deletion and inform the user:
   ```
   Audio deleted: audio.mp3 removed (recording contained unconsented content beyond the meeting)
   ```

This step is **not optional** and does **not require separate user
confirmation** — the user already approved the trim, which implicitly
acknowledges the recording went beyond the meeting boundary.

### Step 6 — Verify

Read back the last 10 words of the trimmed transcript to confirm the file was
written correctly and ends at the expected point. Confirm `audio.mp3` no longer
exists in the session directory.

## Quality checklist

- [ ] Session ID validated and transcript exists
- [ ] Logical end identified based on farewell/closing signals
- [ ] Trim point shown to user and approved before modification
- [ ] Transcript file written correctly with valid JSON
- [ ] Audio recording deleted (contains unconsented content beyond meeting)
- [ ] Post-trim verification confirms expected ending and audio removed
