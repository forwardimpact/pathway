Used by Step 3 of `req-track`. Default to `new` if no advancement signals are
found. Read the full thread chronologically; the most recent signal wins.

- "work trial" / "assessment project" / "paid trial" → `work-trial`
- "not what we're looking for" / "pass" → `rejected`
- "candidate withdrew" / "no longer interested" / "accepted another offer" →
  `withdrawn`
- "extend an offer" / "make an offer" → `offer`
- "they've accepted" / "start date" → `hired`
- "put on hold" / "come back to later" → `on-hold`
