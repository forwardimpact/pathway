Changes to this skill that should be considered for upstream inclusion in

## 2026-03-01

**What:** New skill for processing Hyprnote meeting recordings

**Why:** Meeting notes were being lost — Hyprnote captures transcriptions
but they weren't being integrated into the knowledge base.

**Details:**
- Reads transcription files from `~/.cache/fit/outpost/hyprnote/`
- Extracts people, decisions, and action items
- Creates meeting notes in `knowledge/Meetings/`
- Links attendees to `knowledge/People/` entries

## 2026-02-15

**What:** Increased batch size from 5 to 10 files per run

**Details:**

- Added a note about context window limits for batches > 15
