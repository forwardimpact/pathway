 * Shared roster fixture used across summit aggregation tests. Shape:
 * - reporting team `platform` — Alice (J060+platform), Bob (J060), Carol
 *   (J040+platform)
 * - project `migration-q2` — Bob @ 0.6, External (J060) @ 1.0
 *
 * Proficiency math under the starter standard:
 * - software_engineering has task_completion as its CORE skill,
 *   planning as SUPPORTING, incident_response as BROAD.
 * - J060 base proficiencies: core=working, supporting=foundational,
 *   broad=awareness.
 * - J040 base proficiencies: core=foundational, supporting=awareness,
 *   broad=awareness.
 * - platform track modifies reliability: +1 and delivery: -1. Because
 *   task_completion/planning live in delivery, a platform member loses one
 *   step in those; reliability (incident_response) gains one capped by the
 *   level's max.
 *
 * So at J060 without a track, task_completion = working (working+).
 * At J060 with platform, task_completion = foundational (below working).
 *
 * Fixture below lets the reporting team have one working+ holder (Bob) and
 * the project team have two working+ holders (Bob + External) via J060
 * without the platform track.
