/**
 * Shared test fixtures for landmark tests.
 *
 * These constants consolidate the previously-duplicated MAP_DATA, TEAM,
 * SNAPSHOTS, SCORES, EVIDENCE_ROWS, COMMENTS, and PATTERNS fixtures across
 * the landmark test suite. Tests that need a variant should import the base
 * and spread with overrides, e.g.:
 *
 *   import { MAP_DATA } from "./fixtures.js";
 *   const partial = { ...MAP_DATA, skills: [{ id: "x", name: "X" }] };
 *
 * See spec 640 (specs/640-refactor-test-suite/spec.md).
