  Analyze candidate CVs against the engineering career framework using
  fit-pathway as the reference point. Assess skill alignment, identify track
  fit (forward_deployed vs platform), estimate career level, and produce
  structured assessments. Use when the user asks to evaluate a CV, compare a
  candidate to a role, or assess engineering fit.

# Analyze CV

Analyze a candidate's CV against the engineering career framework defined in
`fit-pathway`. Produces a structured assessment: estimated career level, track
fit, skill alignment, gaps, and a hiring recommendation. Every assessment is
grounded in the framework — no subjective impressions.

## Trigger

Run this skill:

- When the user asks to analyze, evaluate, or assess a CV
- When a new CV is added to `knowledge/Candidates/{Name}/`
- When the user asks "is this person a fit for {role}?"
- When comparing a candidate's background against a specific job level and track

## Prerequisites

- `fit-pathway` CLI installed (`npx fit-pathway` must work)
- A CV file (PDF or DOCX) accessible on the filesystem
- Optionally, a target role specified by the user (discipline + level + track)

## Inputs

- CV file path (e.g. `knowledge/Candidates/{Name}/CV.pdf` or a path the user
  provides)
- Target role (optional): `{discipline} {level} --track={track}`
- Existing candidate brief (if available):
  `knowledge/Candidates/{Name}/brief.md`

## Outputs

- `knowledge/Candidates/{Name}/assessment.md` — structured CV assessment
- Updated `knowledge/Candidates/{Name}/brief.md` — skills and summary enriched
  from CV analysis

## Step 1: Read the CV

Read the candidate's CV file. Extract:

| Field                   | What to look for                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Current role**        | Most recent job title                               |
| **Years of experience** | Total and per-role tenure                           |
| **Technical skills**    | Languages, frameworks, platforms, tools mentioned   |
| **Domain experience**   | Industries, business domains, customer-facing work  |
| **Education**           | Degrees, certifications, relevant courses           |
| **Leadership signals**  | Team size, mentoring, cross-team work, architecture |
| **Scope signals**       | Scale of systems, user base, revenue impact         |
| **Communication**       | Publications, talks, open source, documentation     |
| **Gender**              | Pronouns, gendered titles (never infer from names)  |

## Step 2: Look Up the Framework Reference

Use `fit-pathway` to load the reference data for assessment.

### If a target role is specified

```bash
# Get the full job definition
npx fit-pathway job {discipline} {level} --track={track}

# Get the skill matrix for comparison
npx fit-pathway job {discipline} {level} --track={track} --skills
```

### If no target role is specified

Estimate the most likely discipline and level from the CV, then look it up:

```bash
# See available disciplines and their tracks
npx fit-pathway discipline

# See available levels
npx fit-pathway level

# Look up the estimated role
npx fit-pathway job {discipline} {level} --track={track}
```

**Estimation heuristics:**

| CV Signal                                    | Likely Level     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0-2 years, junior titles, learning signals   | J040 (Level I)   |
| 2-5 years, mid-level titles, independent     | J060 (Level II)  |
| 5-8 years, senior titles, mentoring signals  | J070 (Level III) |
| 8-12 years, staff/lead titles, area scope    | J090 (Staff)     |
| 12+ years, principal titles, org-wide impact | J100 (Principal) |

### Track fit estimation

Use `fit-pathway` to compare tracks:

```bash
npx fit-pathway track forward_deployed
npx fit-pathway track platform
```

Map CV evidence to track indicators:

| Forward Deployed signals              | Platform signals                        |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Customer-facing projects              | Internal tooling / shared services      |
| Business domain immersion             | Infrastructure / platform-as-product    |
| Rapid prototyping, MVPs               | Architecture, system design             |
| Data integration, analytics           | CI/CD, DevOps, reliability              |
| Stakeholder management                | Code quality, technical debt management |
| Cross-functional work                 | Scalability, performance engineering    |
| Multiple industries or domain breadth | Deep platform ownership                 |

## Step 3: Map CV to Framework Skills

For each skill in the target job's skill matrix, assess the candidate's likely
proficiency based on CV evidence:

```bash
# Get skill detail for nuanced assessment
npx fit-pathway skill {skill_id}
```

Use the proficiency definitions from the framework:

| Proficiency    | CV Evidence                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `awareness`    | Mentioned but no project evidence                       |
| `foundational` | Used in projects, basic application                     |
| `working`      | Primary tool/skill in multiple roles, independent usage |
| `practitioner` | Led teams using this skill, mentored others, deep work  |
| `expert`       | Published, shaped org practice, industry recognition    |

**Be sceptical.** CVs inflate significantly. Default **two levels below** what
the CV implies unless the candidate provides concrete, quantified evidence
(metrics, measurable outcomes, named systems, team sizes, user/revenue scale).
Only award the directly implied level when the CV includes specific, verifiable
details — vague descriptions like "improved performance" or "led initiatives" do
not count. A skill merely listed in a "Skills" section with no project context
rates `awareness` at most.

## Step 4: Assess Behaviour Indicators

Check the CV for behaviour signals aligned with the framework:

```bash
npx fit-pathway behaviour --list
```

Map CV evidence to behaviours:

| Behaviour                  | CV Evidence                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Own the Outcome            | End-to-end ownership, P&L impact, delivery metrics |
| Think in Systems           | Architecture decisions, system-wide reasoning      |
| Communicate with Precision | Technical writing, documentation, talks            |
| Be Polymath Oriented       | Cross-domain work, diverse tech stack              |
| Don't Lose Your Curiosity  | Side projects, continuous learning, certifications |

## Step 5: Identify Gaps and Strengths

Compare the candidate's estimated skill profile against the target job:

```bash
# If comparing progression potential
npx fit-pathway progress {discipline} {level} --track={track}
```

Classify each skill as:

- **Strong match** — candidate meets or exceeds the expected proficiency **and**
  evidence is concrete (metrics, project specifics, scope indicators)
- **Adequate** — candidate is exactly one level below expected proficiency with
  clear project evidence, **or** meets the level but evidence is thin
- **Gap** — candidate is two or more levels below expected proficiency
- **Not evidenced** — CV doesn't mention this skill area. **Treat as a gap** for
  recommendation purposes — absence of evidence is not evidence of skill

**Threshold rule:** If more than **one third** of the target job's skills are
Gap or Not evidenced, the candidate cannot receive "Proceed." If more than
**half** are Gap or Not evidenced, the candidate cannot receive "Proceed with
reservations."

## Step 6: Write Assessment

Create `knowledge/Candidates/{Name}/assessment.md`:

```markdown
# CV Assessment — {Full Name}

**Assessed against:** {Discipline} {Level} — {Track}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**CV source:** [{filename}](./{filename})

## Summary

{2-3 sentence summary: overall fit, key strengths, primary concerns}

## Estimated Profile

| Dimension        | Assessment                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Level**        | {estimated level and confidence}          |
| **Track fit**    | {forward_deployed / platform / either}    |
| **Discipline**   | {best discipline match}                   |
| **Gender**       | {Woman / Man / —}                         |

## Skill Alignment

| Skill | Expected | Estimated | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {skill} | {framework level} | {CV-based estimate} | {Strong/Adequate/Gap/Not evidenced} |

### Key Strengths
- {Strength 1 — with CV evidence}
- {Strength 2 — with CV evidence}

### Key Gaps
- {Gap 1 — what's missing and why it matters for the role}
- {Gap 2 — what's missing and why it matters for the role}

## Behaviour Indicators

| Behaviour | Expected Maturity | CV Evidence | Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {behaviour} | {maturity} | {evidence or "—"} | {Strong/Weak/None} |

## Track Fit Analysis

{Paragraph explaining why this candidate fits forward_deployed, platform,
or could work on either. Reference specific CV evidence.}

## Hiring Recommendation

**⚠️ Advisory only — human decision required.**

**Recommendation:** {Proceed / Proceed with reservations / Do not proceed}

Apply these **decision rules** strictly:

| Recommendation               | Criteria                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proceed**                  | ≥ 70% Strong match, no core skill gaps, strong behaviour signals        |
| **Proceed with reservations** | ≥ 50% Strong match, ≤ 2 gaps in non-core skills, no behaviour red flags |
| **Do not proceed**           | All other candidates — including those with thin evidence               |

When in doubt, choose the stricter recommendation. "Proceed with reservations"
should be rare — it signals a strong candidate with a specific, addressable
concern, not a marginal candidate who might work out.

**Rationale:** {3-5 sentences grounding the recommendation in framework data.
Reference specific skill gaps or strengths and their impact on the role.
Explicitly state the skill match percentage and gap count.}

**Interview focus areas:**
- {Area 1 — what to probe in interviews to validate}
- {Area 2 — what to probe in interviews to validate}
```

## Step 7: Enrich Candidate Brief

If `knowledge/Candidates/{Name}/brief.md` exists, update it with findings:

- Add or update the **Skills** section with framework skill IDs
- Update **Summary** if the CV provides better context
- Set the **Gender** field if identifiable from the CV and not already set
- Add a link to the assessment: `- [CV Assessment](./assessment.md)`

**Use precise edits — don't rewrite the entire file.**

If no brief exists, note that the `track-candidates` skill should be run first
to create the candidate profile from email threads.
