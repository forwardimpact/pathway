name: Think in Systems
human:
  description:
    The ability to see beyond individual components to understand how the entire
    system behaves. Like understanding how reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone
    transformed not just deer but rivers, engineers recognize that every
    service, API, and queue is part of a larger whole—isolated changes ripple
    across the system.
  maturityDescriptions:
    emerging:
      Recognizes that systems have interconnected parts; considers immediate
      dependencies in code; understands basic cause-and-effect
    developing:
      Identifies upstream and downstream impacts; uses observability tools to
      trace requests across services; understands feedback loops; maps
      dependencies before making changes
    practicing:
      Maps complex system interactions across technical and business domains;
      anticipates cascading effects; designs systems that degrade gracefully;
      understands how technology changes impact business operations
    role_modeling:
      Shapes systems design practices across their function; conducts chaos
      engineering experiments; influences cross-team architecture decisions;
      creates clarity from complexity; bridges technical systems with business
      processes
    exemplifying:
      Defines organizational systems architecture principles; recognized
      industry authority on complex systems; advises executive leadership on
      systemic risks and opportunities; publishes thought leadership on systems
      thinking in technology organizations

  title: Consider the whole system
  workingStyle: |
    For every change:
    1. Identify upstream and downstream impacts
    2. Consider non-functional requirements (performance, security)
    3. Document assumptions and trade-offs
