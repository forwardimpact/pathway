        - Shows awareness that different users have different expectations
        - Recognizes that monitoring and alerting help detect problems early

      followUps:
        - What do you learn from incidents and how do you apply it?
      lookingFor:
        - Follows a structured incident response process, not ad-hoc
          firefighting
        - Documents findings and drives follow-up improvements

        - Uses error budgets to make objective speed-vs-reliability decisions
        - Adjusts reliability investment based on user impact data, not fear
        - Coaches team to treat reliability work as enabling velocity, not
          opposing it

        importance?
      lookingFor:
        - Connects reliability to user impact in team discussions, not abstract

        How do you support team members in developing reliability engineering
        skills?
      lookingFor:
        - Creates hands-on learning through incident response participation and
          on-call rotations
        - Pairs less experienced engineers with SRE-skilled colleagues on
          reliability tasks
        - Reviews reliability practices in design discussions and code reviews

      text: How do you handle incidents and facilitate post-incident learning?
      followUps:
        - How do you communicate incidents to stakeholders?
      lookingFor:
        - Runs blameless incident reviews that produce actionable improvements
        - Communicates incident status and impact clearly to non-technical
          stakeholders
        - Tracks whether post-incident actions are completed and effective

      text:
        How do you drive reliability culture and balance it with feature
        delivery pressure?
      lookingFor:
        - Uses error budgets to make transparent trade-off decisions with
          stakeholders
        - Frames reliability investment as protecting delivery velocity, not
          slowing it
        - Creates team norms where reliability is everyone's responsibility, not
          an SRE team's
