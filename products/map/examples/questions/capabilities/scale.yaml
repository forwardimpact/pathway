        Your API currently handles 100 requests per second but needs to handle
        1000 RPS in 6 months due to a new partnership. How would you approach
        this?
      context:
        The API is a monolithic Node.js application backed by PostgreSQL.
        Response time P99 is currently 200ms and must stay under 500ms.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - What would you need to measure and understand first?
        - How would you identify the scaling bottlenecks?
        - What architectural changes would you consider?
        - How would you phase the work and validate progress?
      lookingFor:
        - Profiles current system before jumping to solutions
        - Considers horizontal vs vertical scaling trade-offs
        - Identifies database as likely bottleneck
        - Plans incremental validation with load testing
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if the partnership deal accelerated and you had only 3 months?
        - How would you handle if the new load had very different access
          patterns?

      text:
        Your team maintains a data pipeline that processes events from multiple
        sources. It's becoming increasingly difficult to add new sources. How
        would you redesign it?
      context:
        Currently there are 15 event sources, each with custom integration code.
        Adding a new source takes 3 weeks. The team receives requests for 5 new
        sources per quarter.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you analyze the current pain points systematically?
        - What abstractions or patterns would improve extensibility?
        - How would you migrate existing sources without disruption?
        - How would you measure the success of the redesign?
      lookingFor:
        - Identifies common patterns across existing integrations
        - Proposes schema standardization or adapter pattern
        - Plans migration that doesn't break existing functionality
        - Sets concrete targets for new source onboarding time
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if different sources had fundamentally incompatible data models?
        - How would you get buy-in if the team is skeptical of a major rewrite?

      text:
        Your team is responsible for a system that needs to scale significantly,
        but you don't have dedicated infrastructure expertise. How would you
        build this capability?
      context:
        The system needs to 10x in capacity over the next year. Your team of 6
        engineers has strong application development skills but limited
        infrastructure and performance engineering experience.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you assess your team's current capabilities and gaps?
        - What strategy would you use to build the needed expertise?
        - How would you manage the risk during the scaling effort?
        - How would you balance learning with delivery commitments?
      lookingFor:
        - Honestly assesses capability gaps without blame
        - Considers multiple approaches (hire, train, partner, outsource)
        - Creates risk mitigation plan for capability building period
        - Protects learning time while meeting business needs
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if you can't hire and must develop expertise internally?
        - How would you handle if early scaling efforts fail?

      text:
        Your organization's infrastructure costs have grown faster than revenue,
        and leadership wants a 30% cost reduction while maintaining performance.
        How would you approach this?
      context:
        Current cloud spend is $2M annually across 15 teams. Some services are
        over-provisioned, others have inefficient architectures. Teams have
        autonomy over their infrastructure but no accountability for costs.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you analyze current spend and identify opportunities?
        - What governance changes would you propose?
        - How would you drive cost consciousness across teams?
        - How would you ensure cost reduction doesn't impact performance?
      lookingFor:
        - Creates visibility into costs at service and team level
        - Proposes accountability model while respecting team autonomy
        - Identifies both quick wins and architectural improvements
        - Establishes guardrails to prevent performance regression
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if teams push back on cost accountability?
        - How would you handle if major cost savings require significant
          refactoring?
