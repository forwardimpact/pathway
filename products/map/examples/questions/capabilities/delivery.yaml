        A new client needs a dashboard that shows real-time analytics for their
        e-commerce platform. Walk me through how you would approach this.
      context:
        The client has 50,000 daily active users, uses PostgreSQL for their main

      lookingFor:
        - Asks clarifying questions about requirements before diving in
        - Identifies data pipeline, storage, and visualization as separate
          concerns

        - Proposes strangler fig or similar incremental approach
        - Identifies domain boundaries as extraction points
        - Plans for rollback and feature flags
        - Considers team coordination and parallel workstreams
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - How would you handle if stakeholders wanted everything migrated in 6
          months?
