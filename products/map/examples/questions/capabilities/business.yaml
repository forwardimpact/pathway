        The product team wants to add a feature that will increase revenue but
        requires significant technical investment. How would you evaluate this?
      context:
        The feature is an AI-powered recommendation engine. Product estimates
        15% revenue increase. Your team estimates 4 months of work and ongoing
        maintenance costs.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - What questions would you ask the product team?
        - How would you break down the technical cost assessment?
        - What factors would influence your recommendation?
        - How would you present your analysis to stakeholders?
      lookingFor:
        - Balances business value against technical cost
        - Considers ongoing maintenance and operational complexity
        - Asks about success metrics and measurement approach
        - Thinks about alternatives and build vs buy decisions
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if the CEO strongly favors this feature but your analysis
          suggests otherwise?
        - How would you handle if the revenue estimate turned out to be
          optimistic?

        Your company is considering entering a new market that requires
        different compliance requirements. How would you approach the technical
        evaluation?
      context:
        The new market is healthcare (HIPAA compliance). Current systems handle
        financial data but were not designed for healthcare. Leadership wants a
        go/no-go decision in 4 weeks.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - What stakeholders need to be involved in this assessment?
        - How would you structure the technical gap analysis?
        - What are the key decision points you need to surface?
        - How would you communicate risk and uncertainty to leadership?
      lookingFor:
        - Identifies compliance, security, and data handling as separate
          workstreams
        - Involves legal, security, and product stakeholders appropriately
        - Creates structured assessment with clear criteria
        - Communicates uncertainty and risk levels clearly
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What would change if you had 3 months instead of 4 weeks?
        - How would you handle if different stakeholders had conflicting
          priorities?

        Your engineering organization needs to reduce costs by 20% while
        maintaining delivery commitments. How would you approach this?
      context:
        Budget constraints require significant cost reduction. You manage 3
        teams with 18 engineers total. Current commitments include two major
        product launches in the next quarter.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you identify cost reduction opportunities?
        - How would you prioritize cuts while protecting critical work?
        - How would you communicate changes to your teams?
        - How would you ensure commitments are still achievable?
      lookingFor:
        - Analyzes costs systematically (infrastructure, tooling, headcount)
        - Protects high-value work while cutting low-impact activities
        - Communicates transparently with teams about constraints
        - Renegotiates scope or timelines where necessary
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if leadership insists on no headcount changes but still needs 20%
          savings?
        - How would you handle if key team members leave due to uncertainty?

        The board is considering a major acquisition that would double your
        engineering organization. How would you evaluate the technical due
        diligence and integration plan?
      context:
        The target company has 100 engineers, different tech stack, and
        overlapping product lines. You have 6 weeks for due diligence and need
        to present integration risks and synergies to the board.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - What technical areas would you prioritize in due diligence?
        - How would you assess organizational and cultural compatibility?
        - What integration models would you consider?
        - How would you quantify risks and synergies for the board?
      lookingFor:
        - Evaluates architecture, tech debt, and platform compatibility
        - Assesses talent retention risk and cultural differences
        - Proposes realistic integration timeline and approach
        - Presents findings with clear decision criteria for leadership
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if the acquisition goes through despite your concerns?
        - How would you handle if the target's best engineers leave
          post-acquisition?
