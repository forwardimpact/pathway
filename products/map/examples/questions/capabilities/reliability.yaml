        Your service experienced three outages in the past month, each from
        different root causes. How would you approach improving reliability?
      context:
        The outages were caused by database connection exhaustion, a failed
        deployment, and an upstream dependency timeout. SLO is 99.9% and you're
        currently at 99.5%.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you categorize and analyze these incidents?
        - What systematic improvements would you prioritize?
        - How would you balance reliability investment with feature work?
        - What would success look like 3 months from now?
      lookingFor:
        - Looks for patterns across incidents rather than treating in isolation
        - Proposes both reactive fixes and proactive improvements
        - Creates measurable reliability targets
        - Considers observability and early warning systems
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if leadership is pressuring for more features over reliability
          work?
        - How would you structure the team's on-call rotation going forward?

        You're designing the disaster recovery strategy for a system that
        processes customer financial transactions. Walk me through your
        approach.
      context:
        The system handles $10M in daily transactions, uses AWS in us-east-1,
        and currently has no cross-region capability. Budget for DR is $50K
        annual.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - What are the key requirements you need to establish first?
        - How would you structure the technical options analysis?
        - What trade-offs would you present to stakeholders?
        - How would you test and validate the DR plan?
      lookingFor:
        - Defines RTO/RPO requirements with business stakeholders
        - Evaluates active-active vs active-passive vs pilot light approaches
        - Balances cost against recovery capabilities
        - Plans for regular testing and runbook maintenance
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What would you do if a regional outage happened before DR was
          complete?
        - How would you handle if the $50K budget was cut in half?

        Your on-call engineers are burning out due to frequent pages and
        incident response. How would you improve the situation?
      context:
        The team is paged an average of 5 times per week outside business hours.
        Two engineers have asked to leave on-call rotation. Incident response
        often requires escalation because documentation is lacking.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you analyze the current on-call burden?
        - What changes to the on-call structure would you consider?
        - How would you reduce incident frequency and impact?
        - How would you sustain these improvements over time?
      lookingFor:
        - Analyzes incidents to identify patterns and preventable pages
        - Considers rotation structure, compensation, and workload distribution
        - Invests in runbooks, automation, and self-healing
        - Creates sustainable practices rather than short-term fixes
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if leadership says there's no budget for additional on-call
          support?
        - How would you handle if the most experienced engineers refuse on-call?

        Your organization has grown to 20 services owned by different teams but
        has no consistent approach to reliability. How would you establish
        reliability practices at scale?
      context:
        Some teams have mature SLOs and incident response, others don't. Recent
        cross-team incidents took too long to resolve due to unclear ownership.
        Leadership wants to improve reliability organization-wide.
      decompositionPrompts:
        - How would you assess current reliability maturity across teams?
        - What standards and practices would you establish?
        - How would you drive adoption across teams with different contexts?
        - How would you coordinate reliability during cross-team incidents?
      lookingFor:
        - Creates maturity model to meet teams where they are
        - Establishes minimum standards while allowing team flexibility
        - Provides enablement (tooling, templates) alongside requirements
        - Defines clear escalation and coordination for cross-team issues
      expectedDurationMinutes: 15
      followUps:
        - What if teams resist reliability requirements as overhead?
        - How would you handle if different teams have conflicting SLO
          definitions?
