        You're building a feature for a pharmaceutical client's clinical trial
        management system. The PM hands you a spec full of domain terms you
        don't understand.
      context:
        The feature tracks "adverse event reporting" with specific regulatory
        timelines. The spec references ICH E2B guidelines, MedDRA coding, and
        CIOMS forms. Your team has no pharma domain experts. The client expects
        the first deliverable in 2 weeks and will review your data model.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you approach learning enough about this domain to build
          effectively?
        - What's the difference between blindly implementing the spec vs
          understanding the domain?
        - How would you know if you've learned enough to start building?
        - What questions would you ask the client in your first meeting?
      lookingFor:
        - Recognizes that problems benefit from cross-disciplinary understanding
        - Shows interest in domains beyond immediate technical requirements
        - Asks questions that reveal genuine curiosity about the domain
        - Willing to invest in learning unfamiliar territory

        Your team is building a recommendation engine. You have strong backend
        skills but the UX designer keeps talking about cognitive load and
        decision fatigue. You don't understand their concerns.
      context:
        The recommendation engine shows 50 product suggestions. The UX designer
        insists this will paralyze users, citing the "paradox of choice." The PM
        sides with engineering — more recommendations means more sales. The
        designer is frustrated that nobody understands their perspective.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you bridge the gap between the engineering and design
          perspectives?
        - What would you do to understand the UX designer's concerns more
          deeply?
        - How would knowledge of behavioral psychology change your technical
          approach?
        - How do you apply insights from one domain to inform decisions in
          another?
      lookingFor:
        - Applies knowledge from one domain to inform decisions in another
        - Studies adjacent fields to broaden perspective
        - Begins learning the language of other disciplines
        - Sees connections between technical implementation and human behavior

        Your company is deciding between building vs buying a supply chain
        optimization tool. Engineering says build, finance says buy, operations
        says neither option fits their workflow.
      context:
        The build option would take 6 months and give full customization. The
        buy option costs £200K/year but is available immediately. Operations has
        unique workflows around cold chain management for biologics that neither
        option handles well. You've been asked to lead the evaluation because
        you understand both the technical and business sides.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you evaluate this spanning engineering, finance, and operations
          perspectives?
        - How do you speak the language of each stakeholder group?
        - What insights from the operations domain would change the technical
          approach?
        - How do you synthesize cross-disciplinary concerns into a coherent
          recommendation?
      lookingFor:
        - Bridges gaps between engineering, business, and domain expertise
        - Rapidly immerses in new domains to make informed decisions
        - Speaks the language of different stakeholder groups
        - Makes better decisions by understanding broader context

        Your engineering team builds great software but consistently
        misunderstands the commercial context. Features are technically
        excellent but miss what customers actually need.
      context:
        In the last year, 3 features were technically impressive but
        commercially unsuccessful. Engineers don't attend customer calls or read
        commercial reports. The sales team has stopped asking engineering for
        input on product direction. You see a growing disconnect between what
        engineers think is important and what drives business value.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you get engineers to think like business insiders?
        - What cross-disciplinary practices would you champion?
        - How do you translate specialized engineering knowledge into business
          language?
        - How do you create holistic solutions spanning technical and business
          domains?
      lookingFor:
        - Champions cross-disciplinary learning across the function
        - Creates holistic solutions spanning technical and business domains
        - Translates specialized knowledge into accessible explanations
        - Thinks like a business insider, not just an engineer

        Your organization wants to create a new role — "Technical Domain Expert"
        — that bridges engineering and the pharmaceutical business. Nobody
        agrees on what this role should look like.
      context:
        The company builds software for pharma R&D. Engineers lack domain
        knowledge; domain experts lack technical depth. Projects routinely fail
        at the intersection. The CEO wants engineers who can "think like
        scientists." You've been asked to define the role, the hiring criteria,
        and the development path.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you define this role drawing from your polymathic
          experience?
        - How do you build a development path that creates genuine breadth, not
          surface knowledge?
        - How would you influence industry thinking about cross-disciplinary
          engineering roles?
        - What organizational structures would you create to sustain polymathic
          growth?
      lookingFor:
        - Shapes organizational learning strategy across disciplines
        - Advises leadership on cross-functional strategy
        - Influences industry practices around polymathic engineering
        - Recognized as a thought leader bridging technology and business
      expectedDurationMinutes: 20
      followUps:
        - How would you assess whether someone is genuinely polymathic vs
          superficially broad?

        A team member wants to attend a 2-day workshop on pharmaceutical
        regulatory processes. It's not directly related to their current project
        work.
      context:
        The workshop covers FDA submission processes and GxP compliance. Your
        team builds internal tools, not regulatory software. The team member
        says "I want to understand what our company actually does." The workshop
        conflicts with a sprint commitment. Your manager values predictable
        delivery.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you evaluate the value of cross-domain learning for this team
          member?
        - How would you justify this to your manager?
        - What would make you say yes vs no?
        - How do you create a culture where this kind of exploration is
          encouraged?
      lookingFor:
        - Supports cross-disciplinary learning even when not immediately
          relevant
        - Recognizes the long-term value of domain breadth
        - Encourages team members to explore beyond their specialization
        - Balances learning investment with delivery commitments

        Your team of infrastructure engineers struggles to understand why the
        product team makes certain decisions. They build technically sound
        solutions that don't align with product goals.
      context:
        Recent example — the team over-engineered a caching layer for a feature
        that product planned to deprecate in 3 months. Engineers didn't know
        about the deprecation because they don't attend product planning.
        They've asked "why should we care about product strategy?"
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you create opportunities for your team to learn from the
          product domain?
        - How do you make cross-domain knowledge feel valuable, not like extra
          work?
        - What specific practices would you introduce?
        - How do you handle engineers who resist learning beyond their technical
          domain?
      lookingFor:
        - Creates structured cross-disciplinary learning opportunities
        - Makes cross-domain knowledge practically relevant
        - Builds bridges between engineering and other functions
        - Doesn't force breadth but makes it naturally valuable

        You manage a team that is highly specialized — everyone is an expert in
        one narrow area but the system requires decisions that span multiple
        domains.
      context:
        Your team of 8 has deep specialists in database performance, frontend
        UX, API design, and security. A recent architecture decision required
        all four perspectives but no one could evaluate the trade-offs across
        domains. The decision was made by averaging opinions rather than
        synthesizing them. Quality is suffering at the seams between
        specializations.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you structure your team to leverage depth while building
          breadth?
        - What practices would you introduce to break specialization silos?
        - How do you develop T-shaped engineers from I-shaped specialists?
        - How do you handle the tension between deep expertise and broad
          understanding?
      lookingFor:
        - Structures teams to leverage diverse knowledge
        - Breaks down specialization silos with concrete practices
        - Develops engineers toward polymathic breadth
        - Creates environments where cross-domain synthesis happens naturally

        Your engineering function operates in silos — backend, frontend,
        platform, and data teams rarely share knowledge or attend each other's
        reviews.
      context:
        You lead 3 teams with 20 engineers. Each team has strong internal
        culture but there's minimal cross-pollination. When a project requires
        cross-team collaboration, it takes weeks to build shared understanding.
        A recent project failed because the data team's model assumptions
        conflicted with the backend team's architecture, and nobody caught it
        until production.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you model polymathic learning as a leader?
        - What structures would you create for cross-team knowledge sharing?
        - How do you demonstrate the value of breadth to specialists who are
          comfortable in their silos?
        - How do you make cross-disciplinary collaboration a norm, not an
          exception?
      lookingFor:
        - Models polymathic learning visibly as a leader
        - Creates structures that promote cross-team knowledge
        - Demonstrates value of breadth beyond just efficiency gains
        - Builds collaborative culture across specialization boundaries

        The organization wants to hire "full-stack" engineers but keeps
        attracting deep specialists. Meanwhile, the most impactful engineers are
        those with cross-domain knowledge.
      context:
        Exit interviews show that polymathic engineers leave because they feel
        undervalued compared to deep specialists. The promotion criteria reward
        depth. Hiring screens filter for specific tech skills, not cross-domain
        thinking. The CEO observes that competitors with broader engineering
        cultures ship faster.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you redesign hiring and promotion to value polymathic
          knowledge?
        - How do you build organizational incentives for breadth alongside
          depth?
        - How do you coach other managers to value cross-disciplinary growth?
        - How do you balance the need for specialization with the strategic
          value of breadth?
      lookingFor:
        - Shapes organizational structures to promote polymathic culture
        - Redesigns talent practices to value breadth
        - Coaches other managers on developing cross-disciplinary teams
        - Strategic approach to balancing depth and breadth at scale
