        You've been assigned to fix a bug in a service you've never worked on.
        The fix is straightforward but you don't understand why the code is
        structured the way it is.
      context:
        The service handles payment reconciliation. The bug is a simple
        off-by-one error in a date filter. The codebase uses patterns you
        haven't seen before — event sourcing with a custom projection layer.
        Your team lead said "just fix the bug and move on."
      simulationPrompts:
        - Would you just fix the bug or try to understand the broader system?
        - What questions would you ask about the codebase?
        - How would you decide how deep to go given you were told to move on?
        - What would you do if you found something else that looked wrong while
          investigating?
      lookingFor:
        - Shows curiosity beyond the immediate task
        - Asks meaningful questions about why, not just what
        - Willing to explore unfamiliar territory
        - Balances curiosity with practical delivery

        Your team's CI pipeline takes 45 minutes. Everyone accepts it as normal.
        You suspect it could be much faster but nobody has investigated.
      context:
        The pipeline runs unit tests, integration tests, and two rounds of
        linting. It was set up 2 years ago and has been added to but never
        optimized. When you mentioned it might be slow, a senior engineer said
        "it's fine, we're used to it." You have no pipeline expertise.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you investigate this despite not being a CI expert?
        - What would your first experiment be?
        - How would you approach learning about pipeline optimization?
        - How do you handle the pushback from the senior engineer who thinks
          it's fine?
      lookingFor:
        - Investigates root causes independently
        - Experiments with unfamiliar technology without fear of failure
        - Seeks to understand how things work rather than accepting the status
          quo
        - Shows self-directed exploration patterns

        A new AI coding tool claims to reduce development time by 50%. Your
        company is considering adopting it but wants someone to evaluate it
        thoroughly.
      context:
        The tool is a code generation agent that can handle entire user stories.
        Marketing materials are impressive but vague on limitations. Your
        company has 60 engineers. You've been given 2 weeks to evaluate it and
        make a recommendation. No one on your team has used AI agents beyond
        basic copilot tools.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you design your evaluation? What would you test?
        - How do you separate marketing claims from reality?
        - What failure modes would you specifically look for?
        - How would you structure your findings to help the organization decide?
      lookingFor:
        - Systematic approach to investigating new technology
        - Treats the evaluation as discovery, not confirmation
        - Protects time for thorough exploration
        - Discovers requirements through immersion in the problem space

        Your team consistently delivers features on time but rarely questions
        whether they're building the right things. Product requirements are
        accepted at face value.
      context:
        Over the last 6 months, 2 features were shipped and then unused because
        the underlying assumptions were wrong. The team is highly skilled at
        execution but doesn't push back on requirements or explore the problem
        space. When you've asked "why are we building this?" in planning, you
        get polite but empty answers.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you shift the team culture toward questioning and discovery?
        - How do you model curiosity without slowing delivery?
        - What specific practices would you introduce?
        - How do you create safety for engineers to challenge assumptions?
      lookingFor:
        - Drives curiosity through challenging questions
        - Creates environments where exploration is encouraged
        - Models problem discovery orientation
        - Seeks out ambiguity rather than avoiding it

        Your organization wants to become "AI-native" but most teams treat AI
        tools as autocomplete. There's no culture of experimentation with new AI
        capabilities.
      context:
        The company has 200+ engineers. AI tool licenses are available to
        everyone but usage data shows 80% of usage is basic code completion.
        Only 3 teams have experimented with AI agents. The CTO has asked you to
        lead a transformation toward deeper AI integration. Budget is available
        but cultural resistance is strong.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you create a culture of experimentation at organizational
          scale?
        - How do you sponsor initiatives that might fail?
        - How do you influence engineers who are skeptical or intimidated by AI?
        - How would you share learnings across 200+ engineers effectively?
      lookingFor:
        - Shapes organizational culture around curiosity and learning
        - Sponsors experimental initiatives across the organization
        - Recognized as a thought leader in problem discovery
        - Influences practices around innovation and exploration
      expectedDurationMinutes: 20
      followUps:
        - How would you measure whether the organization is becoming more
          curious?

        A team member asks if they can spend a day investigating a new database
        technology. Your sprint is fully committed and you're behind by 2 story
        points.
      context:
        The team member is your most productive engineer. The database
        technology could solve a scaling problem you'll face in 3 months. You've
        never managed competing priorities between exploration and delivery
        before. Your manager tracks sprint velocity closely.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you decide whether to approve the exploration time?
        - How would you frame this to your manager?
        - What boundaries would you set on the exploration?
        - How do you make this a learning opportunity regardless of the outcome?
      lookingFor:
        - Supports team learning and exploration
        - Shows awareness of balancing curiosity with delivery
        - Creates space for investigation even under pressure
        - Treats learning as valuable, not wasteful

        You notice your team only learns reactively — they pick up new skills
        when forced by a project requirement but never explore proactively.
      context:
        The team of 7 engineers is competent and delivers well. But when a
        project required Kubernetes knowledge, nobody had it and the team
        scrambled. This has happened 3 times in the past year. Engineers say
        they'd love to learn but "there's never time."
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you create structured opportunities for exploration?
        - How do you make learning feel safe, not like extra work?
        - What would you do if an exploration produces no tangible outcome?
        - How do you balance your delivery commitments with learning time?
      lookingFor:
        - Creates time and space for exploration
        - Balances delivery with learning proactively
        - Encourages experimentation without fear of failure
        - Makes curiosity part of the team's rhythm, not an exception

        Two of your teams have different approaches to adopting new technology.
        One team experiments constantly but ships slowly. The other never
        experiments but delivers predictably.
      context:
        You manage both teams. The experimental team has found valuable
        innovations but missed deadlines 3 times. The predictable team delivers
        on time but their tech stack is becoming outdated. Leadership is
        starting to question the experimental team's reliability.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you calibrate the right level of exploration for each team?
        - What would you take from each team's culture to improve the other?
        - How do you protect the experimental team from leadership pressure?
        - How do you encourage the predictable team to question their
          assumptions?
      lookingFor:
        - Builds team culture that values questioning assumptions
        - Calibrates exploration against delivery needs
        - Protects space for curiosity while maintaining accountability
        - Creates sustainable patterns for experimentation

        Your engineering function is solving the same problems repeatedly across
        teams because there's no culture of sharing discoveries or asking "has
        anyone solved this before?"
      context:
        You lead 3 teams with 25 engineers total. In the last quarter, two teams
        independently built similar caching solutions. Another team
        re-investigated a technology that was evaluated and rejected 6 months
        ago. Engineers are curious individually but there's no collective
        curiosity.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you create collective curiosity, not just individual curiosity?
        - What structures would you put in place for sharing discoveries?
        - How do you model curiosity visibly as a leader?
        - How do you make "has anyone solved this?" the first question, not the
          last?
      lookingFor:
        - Models curiosity visibly in leadership
        - Creates environments where discoveries are shared
        - Builds collective inquiry practices
        - Drives curiosity as a cultural value across teams

        The organization wants to launch an internal innovation program but
        previous attempts failed because they felt disconnected from real work.
      context:
        Two previous "hack week" programs were cancelled after low
        participation. Engineers felt the initiatives were performative — good
        ideas went nowhere after the event. Leadership still believes in the
        concept but wants a different approach. You've been asked to design
        something that creates genuine, sustainable curiosity.
      simulationPrompts:
        - Why did previous programs fail and how would yours be different?
        - How do you build organizational systems that reward genuine curiosity?
        - How do you ensure discoveries from the program feed back into real
          work?
        - How do you coach other managers to foster curiosity in their teams?
      lookingFor:
        - Builds organizational systems that reward curiosity
        - Creates sustainable exploration programs, not performative ones
        - Coaches other managers on fostering curiosity
        - Balances predictable delivery with organizational learning
      expectedDurationMinutes: 20
      followUps:
        - How do you handle the inevitable pushback from delivery-focused
          managers?
