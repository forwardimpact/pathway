        A product manager asks you to explain why a feature will take longer
        than expected. They need to update the client by end of day.
      context:
        The delay is caused by an unexpected API limitation in a third-party
        service. The PM has no technical background but is under pressure from
        the client. You've been working on this for 2 days and just discovered
        the blocker.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you explain the technical blocker to the PM?
        - What information do they need vs what details can you leave out?
        - How would you frame the timeline impact clearly?
        - How would you write this up if they asked for a brief email summary?
      lookingFor:
        - Communicates basic technical concepts in accessible language
        - Adapts level of detail for the audience
        - Provides clear timeline impact without overwhelming with detail
        - Shows willingness to communicate proactively

        You need to write a specification for a feature that will be partially
        implemented by an AI coding tool. The feature involves complex business
        rules.
      context:
        The feature calculates tiered pricing based on customer segment, volume,
        and contract terms. Previous attempts to use AI for similar features
        resulted in subtle logic errors because the specs were ambiguous. Your
        team relies on AI tools for ~40% of implementation.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you structure the specification to minimize ambiguity?
        - What's the difference between a spec humans can follow and one AI can
          follow?
        - How would you verify the AI interpreted your spec correctly?
        - Walk me through how you'd document one of the pricing rules
      lookingFor:
        - Writes clear specifications that reduce ambiguity
        - Considers how AI tools parse requirements differently than humans
        - Crafts effective prompts and specifications for AI consumption
        - Adapts communication style for different audiences

        You need to present a proposed architecture change to a room with the
        CTO, product managers, and frontend engineers. Each group cares about
        different aspects.
      context:
        The change migrates from a monolith to microservices for the payments
        domain. The CTO cares about strategic alignment, PMs care about feature
        velocity impact, and engineers care about implementation details. You
        have 30 minutes and expect pushback from PMs about the 6-week
        productivity dip.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you structure the presentation for this mixed audience?
        - How do you translate between technical and business language?
        - How do you handle questions from stakeholders with conflicting
          priorities?
        - How do you separate what needs deciding now vs what can be decided
          later?
      lookingFor:
        - Separates concerns precisely for different audiences
        - Translates between technical and business language fluently
        - Facilitates productive discussion among stakeholders with competing
          priorities
        - Enables clear decisions by structuring information precisely

        Your function has recurring miscommunication between engineering and
        product. Requirements are interpreted differently, leading to rework.
      context:
        In the last quarter, 3 major features needed significant rework due to
        specification ambiguity. Engineers blame vague requirements. Product
        managers blame engineers for not asking clarifying questions. You've
        been asked to propose a better process. The function has 40 engineers
        and 8 product managers.
      simulationPrompts:
        - What's the root cause of the miscommunication pattern?
        - What spec-driven practices would you introduce?
        - How do you get buy-in from both engineering and product?
        - How do you mentor others on precise communication without being
          prescriptive?
      lookingFor:
        - Creates spec-driven development practices that reduce ambiguity
        - Mentors others on precise communication across the function
        - Bridges communication gaps between engineering and product
        - Drives clarity as a core value, not just a process

        The organisation wants to adopt spec-driven AI development but has no
        standards for how specifications should be written across teams.
      context:
        Teams use different formats, levels of detail, and terminology. AI tool
        effectiveness varies wildly between teams. External clients are starting
        to ask about the company's AI development methodology for compliance
        purposes. You've been asked to lead the standardization effort.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you define organizational communication standards?
        - How do you balance standardization with team autonomy?
        - How would you represent this externally to clients and industry?
        - How would you measure whether communication precision is improving?
      lookingFor:
        - Shapes organizational standards for technical communication
        - Defines spec-driven AI development practices at scale
        - Represents the organization's approach externally with authority

        You notice that standup updates from your team are vague — "still
        working on it" with no specifics. Sprint planning decisions are being
        made on incomplete information.
      context:
        Your team of 6 engineers has been together for 3 months. Some members
        are quiet and uncomfortable speaking in groups. Others give detailed
        updates but talk for too long. The standups regularly run over 15
        minutes.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you improve the quality of standup communication?
        - How do you coach a quiet team member to share more effectively?
        - How do you coach a verbose team member to be more concise?
        - What structure or format would you introduce?
      lookingFor:
        - Identifies communication gaps affecting team effectiveness
        - Coaches individuals on clear, concise communication
        - Creates structures that support better communication

        A team member's pull request descriptions are consistently unclear,
        causing reviewers to misunderstand the intent and approve problematic
        changes.
      context:
        Two bugs in the last month were traced back to PRs where the reviewer
        didn't understand the full scope of the change. The team member is
        technically strong but their written communication is ambiguous. Other
        team members are reluctant to review their PRs.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you give feedback on their communication without undermining
          their technical confidence?
        - What would you suggest as a PR description standard?
        - How do you make clear communication a team expectation, not just an
          individual issue?
        - How do you verify the coaching is working?
      lookingFor:
        - Provides constructive feedback on communication skills
        - Sets clear communication expectations for the team
        - Coaches without undermining technical confidence
        - Makes communication quality a team norm

        Your team needs to communicate a breaking API change to 5 consuming
        teams. Past breaking changes caused friction because of poor
        communication timing and unclear migration guides.
      context:
        The API change removes deprecated endpoints used by at least 3 teams.
        Your team wants to ship in 4 weeks. Previous breaking changes led to
        angry messages in Slack and escalations. You need to manage both the
        technical communication and the stakeholder relationships.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you structure the communication plan?
        - How do you help your team communicate effectively with each consuming
          team?
        - What communication standards would you establish for breaking changes?
        - How do you handle a team that doesn't respond to the migration
          timeline?
      lookingFor:
        - Establishes communication standards for high-impact changes
        - Coaches team members on stakeholder communication
        - Creates communication practices that become team norms

        Cross-functional meetings in your area are unproductive — engineers and
        product managers talk past each other, decisions aren't captured, and
        actions are unclear.
      context:
        You manage 3 teams and participate in weekly cross-functional meetings
        with product, design, and engineering. The meetings often end without
        clear decisions. Product managers feel engineers don't listen to
        business context; engineers feel product doesn't understand technical
        constraints.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you model precise communication in these meetings?
        - What facilitation practices would you introduce?
        - How do you establish shared language between engineering and product?
        - How do you make your communication standards visible to peers?
      lookingFor:
        - Models precise communication in leadership settings
        - Establishes facilitation practices that drive clarity
        - Creates shared language across functions
