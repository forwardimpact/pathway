        You are asked to add a caching layer to a frequently called API
        endpoint. The change seems straightforward but the endpoint is used by
        three other services.
      context:
        The endpoint currently handles 500 requests per second. Two of the
        consuming services expect real-time data, while the third can tolerate
        staleness. Your team owns the endpoint but not the consuming services.
      simulationPrompts:
        - What would you check before implementing the cache?
        - How would you find out who depends on this endpoint?
        - What could go wrong with adding caching here?
        - How would you communicate the change to the other teams?
      lookingFor:
        - Considers immediate dependencies before making changes
        - Recognizes that systems have interconnected parts
        - Asks about downstream impact rather than assuming it's safe
        - Shows basic cause-and-effect thinking

        After deploying a database migration, response times on an unrelated
        service have increased by 300%. There is no obvious connection between
        the two.
      context:
        The migration added an index to a high-traffic table. The affected
        service shares the same database cluster but uses different tables.
        Monitoring shows increased lock contention during peak hours.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you investigate the connection between these two events?
        - What tools would you use to trace the impact?
        - How would you map the dependencies that led to this?
        - What would you do to resolve it while the investigation continues?
      lookingFor:
        - Identifies upstream and downstream impacts methodically
        - Uses observability tools to trace cross-service effects
        - Maps dependencies before proposing a fix
        - Understands feedback loops in shared infrastructure

        Your team is proposing to replace a synchronous API with an event-driven
        architecture. The change would affect 6 consuming services across 3
        teams.
      context:
        The current API handles order processing. Moving to events would improve
        throughput but change data consistency guarantees. Two of the consuming
        services have SLAs that depend on synchronous confirmation. Business
        stakeholders want the throughput improvement for peak season.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you map the full system impact of this architectural change?
        - How do you handle the teams whose SLAs depend on synchronous
          behaviour?
        - What would your migration approach look like?
        - How would you help business stakeholders understand the trade-offs?
      lookingFor:
        - Maps complex interactions across technical and business domains
        - Anticipates cascading effects of architectural changes
        - Designs migration that degrades gracefully during transition
        - Understands how technology changes impact business operations

        A major outage was caused by a cascading failure across 4 services. The
        post-mortem reveals that no single team understood the full dependency
        chain.
      context:
        The cascade started with a memory leak in Service A, which caused
        timeouts in Service B, which triggered retries that overwhelmed Service
        C, which failed over incorrectly to Service D. Each team had local
        monitoring but no one had end-to-end visibility. This is the second
        cascading failure this quarter.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you lead the cross-team investigation?
        - What systemic changes would you propose to prevent cascading failures?
        - How would you create shared visibility across these teams?
        - How do you make the case for investing in system-wide resilience?
      lookingFor:
        - Shapes systems design practices across the function
        - Bridges technical systems thinking with business process impact
        - Creates clarity from complexity for multiple stakeholder groups
        - Influences cross-team architecture decisions

        The organisation is scaling from 20 to 80 microservices. Complexity is
        growing faster than the team's ability to reason about the system.
      context:
        Incident frequency has tripled in 6 months. Teams operate in silos with
        no shared architectural principles. Executive leadership is concerned
        about reliability but doesn't want to slow feature delivery. You've been
        asked to define the systems architecture strategy.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How would you define organizational systems architecture principles?
        - How do you balance team autonomy with system-wide coherence?
        - How would you advise executive leadership on the systemic risks?
        - What governance structures would you put in place?
      lookingFor:
        - Defines organizational systems architecture principles
        - Advises executive leadership on systemic risks and opportunities
        - Creates frameworks that scale with organizational growth
        - Takes an approach recognized as industry-leading

        A team member made a change to your service that broke a downstream
        consumer. They didn't realize the dependency existed.
      context:
        The downstream team is upset and your team member feels terrible. The
        dependency wasn't documented and there's no integration test covering
        it. Your team has 6 members, most of whom are unfamiliar with the
        broader system context.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you help the team member understand what happened?
        - What do you say to the downstream team?
        - How do you help your team understand the broader system context?
        - What would you put in place to prevent similar blind spots?
      lookingFor:
        - Helps team members see how their work fits the broader system
        - Creates context awareness without blame
        - Shows basic understanding of system dependencies
        - Takes steps to improve visibility

        Your team is about to ship a major refactor. Another team's manager
        warns you it might affect their service, but your team can't see how.
      context:
        The refactor changes internal data structures but the API contract
        should remain the same. The other team's concern is based on past
        experience where "internal changes" leaked through. You need to decide
        whether to delay the release to investigate.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you assess the risk the other manager is raising?
        - How do you help your team think about second-order effects?
        - What would you do if your team disagrees with the delay?
        - How do you build a collaborative relationship with the other team?
      lookingFor:
        - Teaches team to think about downstream impacts
        - Takes cross-team concerns seriously even without proof
        - Facilitates systems thinking in planning decisions
        - Builds collaborative relationships across team boundaries

        Your team needs to plan a quarter of work but keeps getting interrupted
        by production issues caused by other teams' changes affecting your
        service.
      context:
        Your service is a critical dependency for 5 other teams. In the last
        quarter, 40% of your team's time was spent on reactive work caused by
        upstream changes. Your team is frustrated and wants to "build a wall"
        with strict API contracts.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you structure your team's work to account for cross-system
          dependencies?
        - How would you work with the other teams rather than building walls?
        - What systemic improvements would you propose?
        - How do you protect your team while maintaining collaborative system
          stewardship?
      lookingFor:
        - Embeds systems thinking into team planning processes
        - Coordinates cross-team to address systemic issues
        - Balances team protection with broader system health
        - Proposes structural improvements, not just coping mechanisms

        You want to invest in chaos engineering but your leadership sees it as
        unnecessary risk. Meanwhile, cascading failures are becoming more
        frequent.
      context:
        Your function has had 5 cascading failures in 6 months. Each post-mortem
        identifies systemic issues but fixes are always local. Leadership wants
        predictable delivery and sees intentional failure injection as
        dangerous. You manage 3 teams that own core platform services.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you make the case for chaos engineering to sceptical
          leadership?
        - How would you implement it safely to build confidence?
        - How do you develop systems thinking capabilities across your teams?
        - What metrics would you use to demonstrate value?
      lookingFor:
        - Models systems thinking in leadership decisions
        - Develops team capabilities for understanding complex systems
        - Makes reasoning visible and transparent to stakeholders
        - Proposes incremental approaches that build trust

        You are leading an organizational initiative to improve system
        reliability, but teams have no shared language or practices for systems
        thinking.
      context:
        You are responsible for a function of 50+ engineers across 8 teams.
        Incident reviews reveal that most outages are caused by teams not
        understanding cross-system impacts. There is no architectural governance
        and teams have conflicting approaches to resilience.
      simulationPrompts:
        - How do you create organizational structures that promote systems
          thinking?
        - How do you balance local team optimization with broader system health?
        - How do you develop a shared language for discussing system complexity?
        - How do you handle complexity that spans multiple team boundaries?
      lookingFor:
        - Creates organizational structures for systems thinking
        - Balances local and global optimization at scale
        - Builds shared understanding of system complexity
