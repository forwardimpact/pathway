// Public entry point for @forwardimpact/pathway.
// The primary consumption mode is the CLI (fit-pathway) — this
// re-export exists so the package conforms to the repo-wide layout
// contract (spec 390) and so consumers who import
// @forwardimpact/pathway directly receive the shared type
// definitions.
