# Vocabulary Standards

Standard terms for skill definitions and behaviour maturity levels. Grades and
their mappings vary per installation—use `npx fit-pathway grade --list` to see
available grades.

## Scope Terms

Use these terms for spheres of influence (ascending breadth):

| Term              | Size             | Example Usage                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Team**          | 5–15 people      | "within your team"              |
| **Area**          | 2–5 teams        | "across teams in your area"     |
| **Business unit** | 500–5,000 people | "across the business unit"      |
| **Function**      | Major capability | "across the function"           |
| **Organization**  | Enterprise-wide  | "shapes organizational culture" |

## Skill Levels

Skills measure **what you can do**. Five levels from learning to mastery:

| Level          | Autonomy              | Complexity            | Verbs                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `awareness`    | with guidance         | basic, simple         | understand, follow, use, ask, learn         |
| `foundational` | with minimal guidance | common, familiar      | apply, create, explain, identify            |
| `working`      | independently         | moderate, multiple    | design, own, troubleshoot, decide, document |
| `practitioner` | lead, mentor          | complex, large        | lead, mentor, establish, evaluate           |
| `expert`       | define, shape         | enterprise, strategic | define, shape, innovate, pioneer            |

**Sentence patterns:**

- **Awareness**: "You understand...", "You can use... with guidance"
- **Foundational**: "You apply...", "You create simple..."
- **Working**: "You design... independently", "You make appropriate..."
- **Practitioner**: "You lead... across teams in your area"
- **Expert**: "You define... across the business unit"

## Behaviour Maturities

Behaviours measure **how you approach work**. Five maturities from interest to
culture-shaping:

| Maturity        | Focus                                | Typical Scope |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `emerging`      | Individual interest, needs prompting | Team          |
| `developing`    | Regular practice with guidance       | Team          |
| `practicing`    | Consistent, proactive application    | Area          |
| `role_modeling` | Influences others, fosters culture   | Function      |
| `exemplifying`  | Shapes organizational culture        | Organization  |

## Quick Reference: Scope by Level/Maturity

| Concept               | ✅ Use                          | ❌ Avoid                       |

| Expert (skill)        | "across the business unit"      | "organizational"               |
