# Commit and Push Changes

Commit all staged and unstaged changes, then push to remote.

Follow the conventions in `CLAUDE.md` (Git Workflow section).

## Process

1. Run `git diff` to review all changes
2. Group related changes into logical, atomic commits
3. Separate feature/logic changes from formatting changes
4. Run `bun run check` to validate changes
5. Assess version bump level for affected packages:
   - Breaking changes → major
   - New features → minor
   - Fixes/refactors → patch
6. Push all commits to remote
